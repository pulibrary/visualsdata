the phrase 'Hobson's choice' originated from the practice of Tobias Hobson (1544-1631), a liveryman in seventeenth-century Cambridge, England, whose customers, especially the students from the university, if unrestricted, would always select his fastest horses and ride them to exhaustion. He knew, as he put it, that 'scholars ride hard.' Knowing that the welfare of the horses would be best served if they were used in rotation, he established a rule that his customers could not select a horse of their own choosing but had to hire the one he placed nearest the stable door, which was the horse that had had the most rest. The customer could accept the offer or reject it, that is, ride off or walk.

Purchased 1998, from Swann Galleries, lot 517.
The Classics Department owns a Roman epigraphy collection. The Roman inscriptions used to be on top of book cases in the old Classics seminar room at East Pyne before the building was renovated. I remember the collection from seeing them at Brown Bag lunches in Classics during the 1990s. We have one Roman stone inscription here in RBSC. I don't know if it is part of the Classics Department's collection, but it might well be. Dale Royance used to keep it in front of a window in GA. With Bill Joyce's permission, I put it on display in the Boyd Room. This is the Roman stone that we allowed Dan-el Padilla Peralta to sample several years ago in order to determine the place of origin of the stone itself, which turned out to be Greece. This was for his senior thesis. Harriet Flower was his advisor. D. Skemer 3/09

Despite this reading '80' on the GA copy, this plate first appeared as number 33 in H's series number 3 which Muller dubs 'Fransche Godsdienstooriogen' The date on the print '22 August 1572' is famous even today -- it's the date of the 'St Bartholomew's Massacre.' In particular, this print shows the caputure and execution of Admiral Coligny, leader of the Hugenots. Muller gives this title to the plate 'Moord in den Bartholomeusnacht'. I suspect the GA print is renumerated when the plate was used again. I don't have date of publication, but the latest date in series 3 is 1573. So this is after 1573. Ferguson 3/2006
This massacre of which Protestants were the victims occurred in Paris on 24 August, 1572 (the feast of St. Bartholomew), and in the provinces of France during the ensuing weeks, and it has been the subject of knotty historical disputes. The first point argued was whether or not the massacre had been premeditated by the French Court — Sismondi, Sir James Mackintosh, and Henri Bordier maintaining that it had, and Ranke, Henri Martin, Henry White, Loiseleur, H. de la Ferrière, and the Abbé Vacandard, that it had not. The second question debated was the extent to which the court of Rome was responsible for this outrage. At present only a few over-zealous Protestant historians claim that the Holy See was the accomplice of the French Court: this view implies their belief in the premeditation of the massacre, which is now denied by the majority of historians. For the satisfactory solution of the question it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the attempted murder of Coligny on 22 August and his assassination on the night of 23-24 August, and the general massacre of Protestants. --Catholic Encyclopedia
