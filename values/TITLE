The part of the Administration that feels very much indorsed
The "dirty shirt" assuming colossal proportions, while the "bloody" is becoming Lilliputian
A warning to the howling, greedy dogs
Growing more and more transparent
Practical political platform makers
Ireland's worst enemies
The "practical politician," the curse of our country
Highway boycotting
Not too thin
A political "tie-up"
His own avenue will be well paved
The plumb of it
A little too near home rule
'Rah! 'Rah! 'Rah! C-O-L-U-M-B-I-A!
The practical politician's report
The Herald and Courier of editorial brotherly love and good-will

Poesie by a revolutionary poet, Demjar Bedng
In the tremendous growth of the national culture on a socialist basis will find its expression the victorious growth of socialism in the U.S.S.R.
Soviet society would make women heroes, celebrating motherhood and giving women new occupations such as architects or machinists. They would raise their children in modern planned housing developments.
The young communists are the supervisors of the parks of culture and rest. We must transform our parks into exemplary institutions of rest and recreation for the toiling masses.
Proletariat of the world unite! Let us transform the imperialist war into a civil one.
With good work in the fields we shall strengthen our collective farms

Excuse me, may I see your invitation?
Don't pull my nose so hard; curse it you take it for a sow's ear
Short tails are all the fashion now except with Freshmen
That's a cursed comical story, the [rat?] and the parson's wife. I shall split my sides with laughing.
I'll only take about a dozen more hairs and then your honour will have the true London cut
The Pope going to marry the Empress of Russia, ecod that's rare news but it's all in my eye
I shall lose my dinner you dog if you don't make more haste
Don't be alarm'd Mr. Guage, I'll shave you as smooth as the palm of my hand
Do stop that razor again, by G- I'd as soon be shav'd with a carving knife
That's the nattiest wig that ever was seen and so my wife said, and so all my customers have said, and it becomes you hugely
You are the prettiest shaver in England Mrs. Friz. I wish the old-woman was under the turf, you should shave and dress me the rest of my life.
I never had such a cursed tedious job in all my life
That's right at him Towz damn me I'll pit my dog against any don in the whole town, at him again, boy!

Punch illustration: Behind the plotting and scheming in every office, there is someone doing the actual work and that someone, Rogers, better be you.
Punch illustration: To the good old days when you could just come right out with it and offend whoever you pleased and nobody cared!
Punch illustration: It's 3:AM. Do you have insomnia?
Punch illustration: Christmas gifts. A tie for Uncle Ed that he'll hate. A vase for Aunt Emma she'll find repulsive. A dress for Grandma she'll return if you can find the sales slip. A pair of slippers for Dad who has four pair already . . .

Behold how in the colledge hall, the surgeons and the doctors all, Are met in consultation wise, a carcase to anatomize: the master there displays his art, sagely discants on every part, and that with ears &amp; eyes and nose, we hear, and see, and smell, he shows
As you like this, young gentlemen, play truant if you please again, how often must I give you warning, to leave your tricks and mind your learning: and as for your part Hussy, you, (I promise ye) shall have your due, I'll teach ye how to romp about, as soon as ever I'm gone out

Now gentlemen - see here's a piece - I hope you'll all bid up for this. Two Guineas - thirty shillings - twenty. Sure gentlemen that will content ye. Who bids? Fifteen dye say? For shame tis not the vaule of the frame. Sixteen is bid for't - once - twice - thrice, sixteen - tis going at half the price.
The gin-retailers, (if there's any) who can by a licence get a penny, are those, who in such manner use it, as if their study was, t'abuse it: who rules and orders never mind, whose shops you may at midnight find throng'd, as with maggots in a cheese, with punks &amp; bunters -- such as these
While thus the revelling debauchee, dandles his mistress on his knee, th' old baud is reckoning up the score, of all that has been spent and more. In comes the monarch of the night, and puts them in a horrid fright, the lover swears, the lady shrieks, behind the door the bully sneeks.
You that for music have an ear, attend the tunefull consort here, see how they warble forth their songs, while one strikes up with shovel and tongs; with pipe and tabor on a ladder, one mounts, one tunes the string &amp; bladder, and others merrily advance, to entertain ye with a dance

Saint of Sweethearts Valentine! Lover's Songs, collected and edited by Alice L. Williams.
Such Love is fit to frighten cats, midnight owls and fluttering bats
Get your face mended!
Why don't you earn your wages?
To an elderly wheelwoman
A scandal monger [copy 1]
Won't we wish we had an axe!
Flirt
A fright
Your bicycle face is one of the dangers of the road
Touched again, you fool!
Your airs are disgusting
Extremes
Let us see you in the "altogether"
You don't look so fine as you think you do
False-faced
A living question mark!
A "cop"
A scandal monger [copy 2]
You are a Jay floor walker and no mistake
In this face, by its grace, you can trace Erin's race
You're a hoodoo of an electrician
The New-Woman shop girl
Your character in the near future
Too much chin
The novel-reader
To a female bowler
A dough-head
Don't borrow money from your friends pitch in and earn some yourself
An old night-owl
Don't borrow money from your friends pitch in and earn some yourself

To a dragoon
Who merely looks for conquering, may for a time succeed; but the end of all the flourishing, will be the greatest need.
By Jove, a "happy" pair! His second teeth out and she with white hair.
Absorbed in thought about a wedding ring, hey!, hey! Mistress--you lost something!

I do not forget you
Will you be my Valentine? A pledge of my love.
I would be remembered!
With my love. Many happy returns.
I could not love the dear, so much, loved I not honor more
To my Valentine. When Daphne to the baytree fled . . . .
Saint Valentine's Day. Love is life's best glory.
In token of my friendship
Best wishes
To my Valentine
Love token. Heartfelt wishes.
To my Valentine. I'd walk with Thee in rain or shine, my own and sweetest Valentine.
To my Valentine. In these blue forget-me-knots . . . .
Untitled [Angel on star]

New Yorker illustration: Daddy's gone back to camp, Helen is at the canteen, Bill's at a troop meeting, and Mother's still at the plant. Is there anything I can do for you?
New Yorker illustration: Never mind. It wasn't important.
New Yorker illustration: Haven't you anything non-military? Herbert is more interested in the postwar world.

New Yorker illustration: Taking an all-round view of the situation, our best bet would be a crime story, semi-documentary, done in the form of a musical comedy, and laid in Italy

New Yorker illustration: What's the meaning of this, Harris? Didn't you get my get-well card?
New Yorker illustration: But Dad, it's not like when you were a boy. The smoke in these cigarettes is pulled through tiny, scientific, mentholated air pores, where thirty-five thousand filters trap the nicotine and tars, and protect the throat from harmful irritation.
New Yorker illustration: What, may I ask, makes you so sure Nixon hasn't got a chance?
New Yorker illustration: I swear that someone, somewhere, is bouncing signals off my head
New Yorker illustration: We can't go on meeting like this, Allen. It's ruining my eyes.
New Yorker illustration: That's my opinion, but before you start actual proceedings please feel free to consult another bartender
New Yorker illustration: At this point, men, if you can't think of anything unpleasant to say, don't say anything
New Yorker illustration: It's simply beautiful, Mrs. Benson, but I'm not sure there's a place for it at the county level
New Yorker illustration: Look, Ed, can I call you back later?

New Yorker illustration: And how have things been with you, Harry?
New Yorker illustration: Can I have the key to the club tonight, Dad?
New Yorker illustration: For heaven's sake, Marjorie! We're discussing deterrents, not detergents.
New Yorker illustration: I know it's easy to draw conclusions about those things, but that's the third Barry we've had this month
New Yorker illustration: Now, for the time breakdown, tax-wise, I figure Ed veered away from business to golf for eight minutes; you, Fred, were on your son's algebra block for approximately ten minutes; and I returned to the discussion of the contract . . .
New Yorker illustration: But, Pedro--the Yankee surveillance!

New Yorker illustration: Now, this job will start you at six hundred a month--which, incidentally, happens to be thirty dollars more than I make
New Yorker illustration: And for five dollars more my wife will sniffle into her handkerchief, and say, "God bless you."
