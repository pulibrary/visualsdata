   1 New Yorker illustration: A little travelling music, if you please, Margaret

   1 New Yorker illustration: I was particulary moved by your remarks on the evils of flouridation and off-track betting
   1 New Yorker illustration: I was shot out here to the New York Office, my wife's company whisked her off to Denver, and Lord only knows what happened to the children.
   1 New Yorker illustration: I wish I could describe it to you, Herb - the sun pouring a flood of gold into the valley, the lake set like a sapphire amid the denser green of the trees, the hills of more tragic cast, rolling off to the horizon
   1 New Yorker illustration: I wish I were rich, handsome, well tailored and well groomed, elegant, dashing, distinguished, and yet much admired by my peers
   1 New Yorker illustration: I wouldn't be the person to ask. It seems I'm your lame-duck father.
   1 New Yorker illustration: I wouldn't know, unless it's that Nehru's out and Gandhi's in
   1 New Yorker illustration: I wrote Woodrow Wilson the same thing in 1917, and he didn't answer me either
   1 New Yorker illustration: I'd have more faith in your innocence if you hadn't tried to pay my retainer with those phony twenties
   1 New Yorker illustration: I'd like a medium-priced respite from the cares of the day
   1 New Yorker illustration: I'd like a very dry martini straight up, and bring a little something of yourself to it, Louie
   1 New Yorker illustration: I'd like some inexpensive little thing for someone who barely squeaked by
   1 New Yorker illustration: I'd like to purchase something, but I don't know what
   1 New Yorker illustration: I'd like to read a telegram that's just poured in

   1 New Yorker illustration: I'll buy that
   1 New Yorker illustration: I'll have orange juice, scrambled eggs, toast, and coffee
   1 New Yorker illustration: I'm afraid I must concur with Dr. Hamilton and Dr. Movin. The cause of death was taxes.
   1 New Yorker illustration: I'm afraid you'll have to come with us. That special offer you took advantage of was open to new readers only.
   1 New Yorker illustration: I'm canceling my appointments for the next three days, Mrs. Belden -- I'm having the couch done over
   1 New Yorker illustration: I'm earth! I'm air! I'm fire! I'm water!
   1 New Yorker illustration: I'm going straight home, make myself a nice cup of hot chocolate, and read "A Girl of the Limberlost"
   1 New Yorker illustration: I'm grateful for your offer, but how would it sound to the tax examiner when I said, "A little fairy brought me the swimming pool, the Bentley, and the cabin cruiser"?
