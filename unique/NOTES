   1  Item description: Original drawing from Alfred Pach’s personal copy of the 1935 Artists and Writers Golf Association membership directory. Pach's copy of the directory included original autographs and illustrations by the Association's members, some on the verso of printed pages, some on separate leaves. Alfred Pach (1884-1965), was the son of Gotthelf, one of the original Pach Brothers, photographers in NYC. Al’s brother was more famous, the artist Walter Pach. Rube Goldberg wrote the foreword for the directory as well as captions for each member’s portrait. Pach photographed the portraits for the directory.
   1 "A variant version in oils of Plate 25, Birds of America, with added landscape background showing distant mountains." Howard Rice, "Princeton University Library Chronicle" XXI, 1&amp;2 (Autumn, 1959 &amp; Winter, 1959)
   1 "The High Mettled Racer as a Hunter". Now Reynard's turn'd out and o'er hedge and ditch rush 'Dogs, Horses and Huntsmen, all hard at his Brush, Through Marsh, hedge and brier, led by their sly prey, They by scent and by view, cheat a long tedious day, While alike born for sports of the field and the course, Always sure to come through a staunch and Fleet Horse, When fairly rundown, the Fox yields up his breath, The high mettled Racer is in at the death.
   1 "The High Mettled Racer" as a Cart Horse. Till at last having labour'd, drudg'd early and late, Bow'd down by degrees, he bends on to his fate, Blind, old, lean and feeble, he tugs 'round a mill, Or draws sand, till the sand of his hour glass stands still. And now, cold and lifeless, exposed to the view, In the very same cart which he yesterday drew, While a pitying crowd his sad relicks surround, The high mettled Racer is sold to the hounds.
   1 "The High Mettled Racer" as a Hack Horse. Grown aged, used up and turn'd out of the stud, Lame, spavin'd and windgalled, but yet with some blood, While knowing postillions his pedigree trace, Tell his Dam won this sweepstakes, his Sire that race, And what matches he won, to the Ostlers count o'er, As they loiter their time at some hedge ale house door, While the harness sore galls, and the spurs his sides goad. The high mettled Racer's a hack on the road.
   1 "The print you have is based on a preliminary drawing for the painting of a group of Awabi divers from the Siebold Collection. Siebold commissioned the paintings from Hokusai in 1826. They are done in a pastiche "Western" style. The drawing(s) used to belong to the famous French collector Henri Vever. It seems as Vever commissioned this print to be done after the drawing of one of the figures in the above mentioned drawing(s). Date of the print is 1890-1905. The Vever group of drawings for the were sold by his grand son to a private French collector in the 1960s and later resold at public auction in La salle de Vente, Hotel Drouot. The print is very rarely seen." Anders Rikardson

   1 A note from a reader: "There is only one version of the old violin.the first production run was done by Wm. M Donaldson, Donaldson Lithographing in cincinnati,Ohio. After that business was sold Wm M (my Great Grandfather) built The Donaldson Art Sign Co in Covington Ky, accross the river from Cincinnati. The same stones were used for all production runs. All prints were dated 1887 for Copyright. The first run was marked Donaldson Lithographing. Later runs said Donaldson Art Sign. great grandfather received title to the work in partial payment of a large and growing debt. the piece above is not an artists proof.all sheets were shipped with full margin(including color bars and registration) the prints are actually water transfer decals. The top(second)coat of varnish is a water based glue and the un printed sheets were coated with water based varnish and adhesive. the prints were placed in a waterbath and applied to a clean sheet of glass. then the paper backing was pealed away. the effect was remarkable, but after 100 years of heat and humididy only a handfull of the mounted versions remain. the article mentions the U.S.Supreme court case. it involved only Donaldson Lithographing and another lithographer and had nothing to do with tuchfarber. The family still has a number of the tuchfarber prints."

   1 Depiciton: A dashing young officer . . . .is laying ardent siege to the ordinary person of a rich dowager, fat, not fair, and decidedly forty. Indeed, the lady is more than old enough to be the mother of her insidious admirer. . . . . The lady, a vain piece of antiquated and frivolous vulgarity, is loaded with massive jewellry . . . . Her feathers are profuse, and she wears a boa of an extinct kind, famous in the annals of contemporary fashions, known as a rattle-snake.
   1 Depiciton: Napoleon, before his reverses became of a decided character, contemplating realizing the conquests he had in hand, with a possible view of retiring from the trade. The Emperor has a sale-pulpit, and is himself officiating as auctioneer. The lot which is being offered is the crown of Spain.....  The Empress is standing behind her husband, with the infant prince in her arms. Napoleon's heir is dressed in a uniform like his father's, his face is that of a monkey. smoking his pipe with his accustomed philosophy. A British tar is patting him on the back, as his very cordial ally, and ridiculing the Corsican's failure. The King of Wurtemburg, Russia pictured as a Cossack, Austria as a huzzar, Prussia, Bavaria, and other Powers are present.....
   1 Depiciton: The comicalities of a masquerade are set forth with due observation of the leading characteristics. Prominent among the maskers is a lady-magician, with her divining-wand and a book of the 'black art,' confronting a nondescript necromancer and his zany. There is a noble-man wearing horns as a becoming decoration for his head. And our old friend Punchinello, with a guitar, putting himself into grotesque contortions. There is a composite personage, a kind of Janus, and established feature in old bal masques, one side male and the other female. There is a Folly, a councillor, and the usual attendance of dominos, masquers and characters, whose disguises are of a speculative description.
   1 Depiciton: The scene is a kitchen. A servant is disporting herself before a large glass, in borrowed plumage, in the hat, feathers, and train of her mistress, and flourishing a fan. Meanwhile, a group of amused spectators are peeping in at the pantry door, while the cat, more practically inclined, has knocked over a dish, and is availing herself of the opportunity of making off with a fine fish prepared for dinner.
   2 Depiction The coarse humours of a spirit-celler are served up with a tragic accompaniment. A young female is stretched incapable and asleep, sunk in all the degradation of dead drunkenness. A man who is no longer master of himself is raising his tumbler, with a tipsy desire to have it replenished. The apparition of King Death, bony, frightful, and sinister, is grinning over the back of the soddened tippler's chair, recruiting his legions from a fruitful source he is supplying the rummer of the drunken wretch from his own vial, little more fatal than the fluid which is debasing and deadening its victims around.  A stout woman, also sinking into tipsy apathy, is roused by the shock of finding the king of terrors added to the company she is thrown off her balance with a start, and, falling backwards on the stone floor of the vault, she will probably break her neck, as the artist's intention seems to hint and furnish Death with another customer.
   1 Depiction [Abroad and at Home]: Interior scene. Room with handsome man reclining on a couch before the fire. On the table by his side are fruit and wine, on his knee there dallies an elegant creature, the lady's maid is figured in the background, regaling herself with drops on the sly.
   1 Depiction [At Home and Abroad]: Interior scene. Room with servant carrying a warming-pan. A lady, of the developed "fat, fair and forty" order, is preparing to go to bed.

   1 Depiction: "I am a Friar of orders Grey, And down the valleys I take my way. I pull not Blackberry, Haw or Hip. Good store of ven'son does fill my scrip. My long Bead-roll I merrily chaunt, Wherever I walk no money I want. And why I'm so plump, the reason I'll tell, Who leads a good life is sure to live well. What Baron, or Squire, or Knight of the Shire Lives half so well as a Holy Friar? After supper of Heav'n I dream, But that is fat pullets and clouted cream. Myself by denial I mortify, With a dainty bit of a Warden pye. I'm cloth'd in sackcloth for my sin, With old Sack wine I'm lin'd within, A chirping cup is my Matin song, And the vesper's bell is my bowl - ding dong! What Baron, or Squire, or Knight of the Shire Lives half so well as a Holy Friar?"
   1 Depiction: "In the natural history of the ostrich it has been observed that when the bird is closely pursued he runs his head and neck into a hole, leaving his hinder parts exposed. Concluding no doubt that, as he sees no one, no one sees him!" Dundas has thrust his head through a hole in the wall labelled Parliamentary Recess, he cries, "Ah! Ah! Nae one sees me now!" John Bull with his blunderbuss, and his brother Pat by his side, are watching the Scotchman's manoeuvre. "Be asy, brother Pat, I see him as plain as ever. I have plenty of ammunition left, but I shan't fire just at present." This print is founded on the inquiries into Lord Melville's conduct when Treasurer of the Navy.
   1 Depiction: "Infant Industries" looks anxiously at monster ("Free Trade") lurking behind curtain, as man gives infant a dose of "Square Revision".
   1 Depiction: "Romily Freestone" supports a pair of medallions representing the two officers consigned to Newgate for prevarication - "Sandon" and "Clavering's Dumps." Mrs. Clarke's Pyramid, a golden cone, caps the edifice reared on corruption.
   2 Depiction: "Take off the largest dishes, and set them on with one hand, to show the ladies your vigour and strength of back, but always do it between two ladies, that if the dish happens to slip, the soup or sauce may fall on their clothes, and not daub the floor. By this practice two of our brethren, my worthy friends, got considerable fortunes." A stalwart awkward-looking yokel, in a showy livery, is carrying out these useful directions to the letter. While grinning at his horrified mistress, he is upsetting a toureen held loosely in his right hand, over a handsome damsel, and is flooding the tablecloth, to the horror of the company, and the delight of a poodle, which is revelling in the stream. Calmly allowing the joint, gravy, &amp;c., to glide over the back of another dog who is less pleased than his companion.

   1 Depiction: 'Poll' is quite a Cleopatra for beauty, grace and love of pleasure, if not for frailty and splendour. She is reposing with negligent ease in the stalwart arms of a good looking sailor, for want of a more luxurious couch, and her foot is resting on the knee of another favoured swain who seems proportionately proud of the honour. person and condescension of manners essential to make herself adored by poor Jack. She sports the wealth of jewellry supposed to be irresistibly gratifying in his sight - a pair of bracelets, earrings, imposing shoe-buckles, and, to cap all, a pair of watches, with massive chains and heavy trinkets galore, disposed on either side.
   1 Depiction: 'Sweet Poll of Plymouth' has been smuggled on board during the absence ... of the chief officers....  A pretty 'midshipmite' and a black boy are deep in the perusal of volume of fascinating voyages. The rest of the persons represented are, from the dog upwards, variously interested in their fair female visitor. One tar, in a fur cap, is singing verses, with his truant eye fixed on the nymph instead of on his music. Another old salt, who is handing the punchbowl about, has evidently neglected his pipe, which he is vainly endeavoring to rekindle from the bowl of a comrade, who has eyes for nothing but the lady.

   1 Depiction: 2.  What I am - a snivelling wretch. The general is seen in solitary abandonment on the island rock which constituted his miniature kingdom of Elba, shedding tears over `the brief history of my life, which I intend to publish.' This view is, like most of the deductions of satirists, rather beyond the strict veracity of the case. Bonaparte showed himself during his stay in Elba, as it will be remembered, both active and cheerful-minded. And it is recorded that he would discuss with the visitors - who flocked to his miniature kingdom from motives of curiosity - his present condition and his past state with pleasant humour and even jocularity.

A bottle of wine, the refreshment customary, is ordered, and the stern hearts of the sheriff's men are appealed to, while bail is sent for.

   1 Depiction: A National Convention is supposed to have been assembled. The members are thrown into consternation, and the table, round which they have been deliberating over the concoction of their organ the United Irishmen, is upset. A diabolical visitation is sufficient to account for this confusion. A monstrous representative of the Fiend of Evil, with formidable horns and claws, bearing a pitchfork over his shoulder, and with the French cap of Liberty, labelled Anarchy, on his brow, is intruding on the scene, with a masterpiece of his own preparation, setting forth the tender fate which the Irish patriots were likely to meet at the hands of their allies the Jacobins.

'What's that you say, fellow,' retorts the magistrate, 'about a sawpit? - a very improper place to go with such company. I wonder you are not ashamed to mention such a thing, and before my wife too. But, however, as it is your first offence, I will discharge you this time. But never come here with such a story again!'

   1 Depiction: A clerical-looking and corpulent reprobate is receiving the upbraidings of his infuriated spouse, to whom the artist has playfully given some resemblance to a veritable dragon, with teeth, claws, and venom. The position of affairs is further explained by a spirited representation of "Socrates and Zantippe," which hangs on the wall. A pretty servant-maid, who is making a somewhat hasty exit, is supposed to have aroused the jealousy of the virago, whose vials of wrath have brought her stout helpmate to a state of stupefaction and terror.

The Duke of York is in the boot, apparently, 'blowing his own trumpet.' A placard, wreathed in laurel, is on the roof of the carriage, announcing, Acquitted. They are shouting: 'Huzza! glorious news for Old England!' females are encouraging their husbands to cheer. The figure of Mrs. Clarke is represented bursting through the multitude and shaking her fist at her late 'protector' while a stout Churchman by her side is loyally protesting, 'I always said he was innocent!'

   1 Depiction: A collision between the pursuits of rival enthusiasts is pictured under the title of "Butterfly Hunting".  Nothing can stop the fervour of the butterfly collector in this chase of the sportive prey, wantonly flitting all over the flowerbeds, and leading the excited entomologists a pretty dance, carrying destruction to the parterres, and ruination to the tulips, of which the proprietor of the house and grounds is, it appears, a passionate fancier.  The havoc, which is spreading over the beds of his favourites, is reducing him to frenzy as he is awakened from his rest, and surveys from his bedroom-window the field of action, the only wonder is, if he has a loaded gun ready at hand, that he is not tempted to salute the reckless spoilers with a volley.
   1 Depiction: A committee of the Rotten Borough Society, established in 1810 is met to consider the license of the press, to bring all their faculties to bear for the detection of any lurking evidences of libel or treason.

A large man wearing a wig tramples the Magna Charta underfoot whilst the Bill of Rights has been cast into a corner on the right.

A listener is remarking, 'I did not think it would have been done up so soon. I had promised at least a dozen promotions!'
   1 Depiction: A corpulent gentleman, wearing a dressing-gown and nightcap, is yawning and stretching himself in his armchair. His huge head and gaping jaws would furnish forth excellently well a sign for the Bull and Mouth. By his side stands a handsome and highly developed lady, who is taking advantage of the sleepiness of her rude monster to slip a billet-doux into the hand of a military officer, who is waiting in the rear.
   1 Depiction: A corpulent individual has suddenly left the dinner-table, under an impulse to choke.

   1 Depiction: A corpulent sufferer, disabled by gout, is thrown into a dreadful quandary. He is seated by the fire, where the kettle is boiling over, deluging the place, and threatening the invalid with the dangers of scalding. The table, and the little comforts spread thereon, are thrown down in the struggle to get out of the dangerous vicinity/ the gouty cripple is vainly shouting and storming for assistance. His nurse, who is much too young, sprightly and good-looking for her situation, is seen at the door of the apartment, struggling in the embraces of a dashing young spark -- probably the master's undutiful heir. The coquetteries of the pair have engaged their full attention, to the neglect of the unfortunate head of the house, of whose critical position they are delightfully unconscious.

   1 Depiction: A credulous personage, who, judging from his costume, is in a fair position in life, has called to consult a necromancer. The enchanter has a venerable beard, and a divining rod. According to usage he has made a circle of skulls, toads, and other inviting objects, in the centre of which, through a stage trap, he is raising the 'very devil' and has conjured up a pantomimic demon, horned, winged, and grotesquely arranged, holding in one hand a gore-stained dagger, and a goblet of suppositious blood in the other. The knees of the befooled spectator are trembling beneath him. His back is turned to a curtain which conceals a fair enchantress, who is assisting the invocation, and giving a practical turn to the delusion by removing a well-filled pocket-book from the coattail of the simple victim. In the background is the traditional whiskered cat, and the folio of cabalistic signs. A stuffed crocodile is suspended from the roof.
   1 Depiction: A dark beauty of colossal proportions, is embraced by an officer whose figure is dwarfed by comparison with the monster negress.
   1 Depiction: A dashing young damsel has secured the jack-boots, cocked- hat, and long sword of General Junot, and is assuming valiant airs, dressed in these borrowed plumes, and threatening the French commander - who is helpless and in bed - with his own weapons.
   1 Depiction: A dashing young lady of fashion, who has evidently been running ahead of the constable, is 'laid by the heels' in a spunging-house. The apartment in which she is lodged belongs, it appears from a printed notice on the wall, to MacNab, Sheriff's Officer for the County of Middlesex - genteel accommodation for ladies and gentlemen. Heavy locks and bolts to the door, and massive bars to the window, indicate the security of Kitty's keeping. The fair captive does not seem depressed by her confinement: seated before a glowing fire, her legs crossed in easy indifference, the prisoner is drinking bumpers of port wine with her captors. A spectacle by no means unusual in the days of this publication, when the extravagances of people of fashion were constantly leading them to the confinement of a spunging-house.
   1 Depiction: A deceptive old tabby, clad in a juvenile style, is dashing along in a high poke-bonnet. Three or four Don Juans of eccentric exterior are hurrying after her to tender their attentions, an act of gallantry they are likely to regret on close inspection . . . .

   1 Depiction: A favourite cat, the property of a distracted spinster, has been launched upon the water in a bowl, which is shown spinning round with the current, to the terror of the involuntary voyager, whose dread of the immersion combined with her exertions to escape from this embarrassing situation, which threatens to capsize the treacherous craft at every turn, seem to afford the frivolous audience unqualified amusement. A lad is seated on the bank, with a girl by his side - probably the authors of the mischief - holding a barking dog, ready to attack the frightened creature if she comes too near the shore. Parties taking the air . . . And various rustic groups . . . Are diverted at the scene. Not so the owner of the cat. The horrified old maid . . . Is pulling up her skirts and plunging forward in a vain endeavor to reach the slippery bowl, which is out of her reach, while a second old lady is doing her best to assist her friend.
   2 Depiction: A florid beauty, of the fair, fat and forty and full-blown type, is "affecting a modesty, though she had it not." Her eyes are downcast and blush suffuses all over, her cheeks being about the colour of a bumper of rubicund cognac brandy which she is imbibing, probably with a view to hide her sensibility. "Really, gentlemen, if you gaze at me in this manner you will put me quite to the blush."
   1 Depiction: A four horse chaise.
   1 Depiction: A fox-hunting party is passing through a village one of the Nimrods has seemingly formed an attachment for a fair neighbor standing on the back and saddle of his horse, he has contrived to raise himself to the level of the lady's casement, and she is leaning out of window, and rewarding his gallantry with a tender embrace meanwhile her husband in his nightcap, opening the shutter below, is securing a prospect of the proceeding, which has thrown an expression of idiotic consternation over his simple features.
   1 Depiction: A gentleman who is driving four horses harnessed to a sort of curricle, with an elegant and fashionably-dressed female by his side, is thrown into consternation by the sudden apparition of a mounted knight of the road, who, seated on a high-mettled steed, is presenting a pistol full at the driver. The traveller's servant, dressed in his livery, and mounted on a cob, is brought up suddenly by the stopping of his master's vehicle; his face indicates the greatest astonishment at the demeanor of the highwayman and alarm at the unforeseen danger to which his patron is exposed; it does not, however, occur to him to render any assistance.
   1 Depiction: A gentleman, who is evidently on his travels, is thrown into a state of the most furious indignation on arriving at the discovery, as he is retiring to rest, that he and his wife have been put into a bed with damp sheets the lady is wringing the moisture from the offending linen, and the husband is dancing about, gesticulating in frantic fashion and shaking his fist in the face of a pretty servant-maid, who, replying to the summons of the injured guests, is bustling up with the warming-pan in her hand, believing her services are required in that direction.
   2 Depiction: A good pious old soul, wearing a hood, red cloak, clean apron, and pattens, and carrying Wesley's hymns in her hand, is interrogating certain sporting characters, who are lounging at the door of the Ram Inn. "Pray, young man" she enquires of a smart young jockey, "are there any meetings in this town?" To which the jockey replies, "Yes, ma'am, two a year - Spring and October!"

   1 Depiction: A half-clad slave of the thimble is shown squatting on his board in a squalid hovel. His half-starved "helper" is seated by his side.

   1 Depiction: A handsome young huntsman has encountered, in the course of his sport, a pretty country maiden, neatly apparelled, and beaming with all the freshness of rustic simplicity and artlessness. Her budding charms are tempting the youth to court the maiden, to her own manifest embarrassment. Meanwhile the gay Lothario's huntsman is shown in the distance "going" off with the horses. The young squire's hunting, as far as the chase of the fox is concerned, being evidently finished for the day.
   1 Depiction: A husband and wife stand face-to-face in night clothes, each holding a funnel for an enema. The husband also holds a pitcher. A maid observes through a window. On the wall is a sign beginning "Le divin clysour. . ."
   1 Depiction: A lad is bringing the well-attended son of Mars his monstrous jack-boots, of a size and weight to displace the great guns of his battery with considerable effect. A second officer is enveloped in his powdering-gown, while his barber-valet is smothering him with volumes of violet-clouds from his puffing apparatus. Another hero appears reluctant to abandon his morning slumbers; he is seated, in his shirt, gaping frightfully, on the side of his bed.
   1 Depiction: A lady about to drub her husband, who stands shamed-faced and helpless at being caught in the act with the serving maid, a good favoured wench, now glancing over her shoulder at her fat master.

   1 Depiction: A member of the Hebrew tribe, who carries a bag slung on his arm, is bearing forbidden luxuries to two fair representatives of his race. A couple of Jewesses, whose persons are resplendent in jewelry, are leaning over the wicket-gate of their premises, lost in admiration at the spectacle of a little stranger - a sucking pig - which the tempter, who has led the maternal sow and entire porcine family astray, is holding out for Mrs. Shevi - a sufficiently motherly-looking lady - to salute with a kiss. Another Hebrew gentleman, who is overlooking this transaction, has his face thrown into horrified contortions and his hair standing on end at making the discovery of this incredible depravity. Possession of the Jew clothesman is explained by a handbill advertising: five pounds is promised for information of the whereabouts of the "wanderers".
   2 Depiction: A mixed scene of suffering and indifference. Propped up in a pillowed arm-chair, before the fire, is a melancholy invalid, old, decrepit, and ill-favored. By his side is a list of "Remedies against discontents." "Cure of jealousy" &amp;c. On the mantel is an array of doctor's bottles, and a hatchment, - groans, griefs, sadness, - forms a cheerful adornment for the chimneypiece. Behind the sufferer, whose last hour, it seems is approaching - since Death has thrust his head, arm and hour-glass through a window above his head - is seated a blooming young damsel decked out in all the attractiveness of an evening toilette. Planted at a table by her side is a dandified admirer. Before them a dessert is arranged, and decanters of wine are ready to hand.
   1 Depiction: A pair of horsemen are endeavoring to put on a sportsmanlike appearance, which is somewhat disturbed by the restiveness of their steeds. One rider is slipping off, and the other, while his horse is going down on his knees in a reverential posture, is flung over the animal's head.
   1 Depiction: A party of sailors in a cabin are fitting out a handsome young creature to "run the gauntlet" of the Custom-house officers, or rather to go on shore, with as full a cargo of excisable articles as they can secure round her person. Huge pockets of "old Japan china, tea, gum", etc. are disposed round her waist, together with a small keg of "coniac" and a flagon of otto to roses. Chests of Congou and Souchon and flasks of arrack are standing about.
   1 Depiction: A physician has been called in, and, with his gold stick in hand, is examining the condition of certain patients who are suffering from the effects of too indiscriminate feeding. A gouty old gentleman, his wife and their footman are all putting out their tongues - which are white and swollen to an inordinate length. Their features express the greatest alarm, and the look of consternation which is thrown into the doctor's face conveys the reverse of comforting reassurance to the unfortunate gourmands.
   1 Depiction: A policeman who is standing on his beat, flattered that several attractive women smile or giggle at him as they pass by, finally realizes he is pantless.
   1 Depiction: A portly old curmudgeon, a very porpoise in face, expression and figure, is tippling and dozing in a semi-maudlin state, in front of the fire-place. His fair companion, an elegant young damsel, is dressed in readiness to make her escape into more agreeable society. She is fuming with impatience, but dares not venture to move for fear of arousing the attention of her besotted jailer. Her situation is more tantalising from the circumstance that the maid-servant has brought in a billet-doux from a handsome youth, her admirer, who, all impatience, is looking over the shoulders of his messenger.
   1 Depiction: A pretty group, founded on the piscatorial pastoral of Izaak Walton. Venator is seated with his arm round the waist of the pretty milkmaid. Maudlin, her mother, a quaint old dame is discoursing wisdom. Peter is whipping a stream in the rear. The design, by Bunbury, has gained considerable force from the spirited execution his contemporary has brought to bear on the etching.
   1 Depiction: A promenade in a park with four mal
   1 Depiction: A promising young "spooney" is entering on life's dangers . . . "the fair sex, drinking and gaming" being the evils set down to avoid. The novice is evidently well advanced on the downward route, and has fallen among experienced professors of the plucking process. A gaily-dressed lady by his side a "decoy duck", of captivating exterior, is beguiling the senses of the self-satisfied dupe with various familiarities, while a smug stout person, dressed like a parson, is discreetly keeping up the spirit of the affair by filling the glasses and manufacturing fresh supplies of punch, which the "spooney" is imbibing freely and without regard to the consequences. A pile of gold and notes has been laid on the table by this very innocent pigeon, and opposite to him sits the crafty and accomplished "rook" . . . . Who, by a skillful manipulation of the cards . . . . Bids fair to succeed in leaving the pigeon "without a feather to fly with."
   1 Depiction: A prosperous looking gentleman, between two angry females of different walks in life, one with a child, and both reproving him in their anger at his inconstancy.
   2 Depiction: A ragged match-seller is elevated into a "timber merchant". A postman becomes a "man of letters". A gardener is raised to a "Master of the Mint". A Jew hawker who cries "Any old clothes to sell" is changed to a "merchant tailor". A sexton, pressing down the mould on a grave, is transferred into "a banker". A poultry dealer easily becomes a "Turkey merchant".
   1 Depiction: A red train with Soviet markings, flying a Soviet flag, and leaving a city (possibly Moscow).
   1 Depiction: A remarkably well-assorted quartet, according to English views at the period, consisting of Napoleon, seated beside his friends Death, the Devil, and Joseph, ex-king of Spain. Napoleon, at whose back is a view of Malmaison, has risen to propose a toast: "Come, gentlemen, here is success to plunder and massacre!" Two of the guests are receiving this sentiment with rapture, but "Joe, the intruder" is sitting in sulkiness, discomfited by the late experience which has been forced on him.
   1 Depiction: A ring of delighted spectators are enjoying the fight and the fun from the benches, while other gentlemen are prudently engaged in restraining their fair partners from getting mixed up in the squabble which is raging fast and furious, thick and general, behind the two 'milling' gentlemen. Ladies using their fists manfully, kicking, tearing hair and throwing themselves into desperate warfare with terrific confusion and effect. In the foreground a fair nymph of interesting but dishevelled appearance, probably the friend of one of the combatants, is falling into a fainting fit, from which the attentions of those who surround her seem inadequate to restore her to consciousness.
   1 Depiction: A sampler, showing kneeling black man holding up his chained hands.
   1 Depiction: A satire of the Rembrandt print "Ecce homo" or "Christ presented to the people". Louis Philippe stands captive and nude on a balcony with back toward viewer, holding enormous enema, presented to large crowd gathered on street below.

   1 Depiction: A scene in a churchyard, with a tombstone to the right, which a lower order.
   1 Depiction: A scene of low life below stairs. A fire is roaring up the kitchen grate, and a fat old cook, slumbering in an armchair drawn up to the kitchen table, has her feet resting on the chimneypiece, and a glass of 'cherry bounce' held in her chubby hand, to refresh her after the exertions of the day. A younger and proportionately comely and comfortable-looking kitchen-maid is also stealing 'forty winks', with her head resting against the chimneypiece while a fat black footman, who completes this evidently easy-going household is indulging in the luxury of repose and pillowing his slumbering woolly pate on the ample shoulders of his shapely neighbor.
   1 Depiction: A scene of the French attacking the city of Carthage.
   2 Depiction: A scene of violence, since a pair of strapping damsels, the pride of their friends, are being carried off bodily, whether they will or no, by two naval officers, whose sailors are waiting by the shore, with a boat put to sea in readiness to bear them, and their abducted charges, off to a ship which is seen at a distance. These unprincipled marauders have made an attack, in broad daylight, on the two biggest and most handsome scholars of Mrs. Crostich's boarding-school for young ladies, while the remainder of the tender flock are taking their walks abroad, with the dame at their head. But neither the vigorous efforts of the school-mistress, nor the exertions of an old gentleman, who has been knocked over in the escape, and is sprawling powerless like a turtle, nor the efforts of a dog which is worrying the retreat of the fugitives, seem likely to hinder the accomplishment of their flight or to prevent the successful completion of their lawless designs.
   1 Depiction: A seal in his left hand.
   1 Depiction: A seated gentlemen in red coat and tri-corner hat is conversing with a standing gentleman in blue coat.
   1 Depiction: A select knot have made for the bar, and are flinging themselves pell-mell over the counter. The chimney and similar places of refuge, are eagerly sought. Tables are mounted. Comfortable citizens are thrown on their backs, like turtles, and trodden on, while the pressure of viler bodies above is expressing a stream of specie from the well-filled pockets of the overthrown. A cat, her tail swollen to abnormal proportions, is making a frantic rush into the midst of the cowering poltroons under the table.
   2 Depiction: A short and corpulent bon-vivant, not unlike a balloon in figure, whose waistband has been abnormally distended by the bibulous propensities of the owner, is standing on tiptoe tilting up to his eager lips a huge punchbowl, too well filled to be lifted bodily--he is transferring the contents to his own inside with much gusto.  While the veteran and inordinate toper is greedily engulfing his last bumping measure he is too busily engaged in the important work in hand to notice that Death, in his bony personality as a ghastly skeleton, is helping to raise the finishing bowl, while the fatal dart is poised over his head, ready for the stroke which will follow this last potation before the tippler has time to recover his breath.
   1 Depiction: A sleeping man is dreaming that little people are interfering with him and his medicine.
   1 Depiction: A slipshod, lean, old anatomy, in dressing-gown and slippers, is straining his ancient crooked neck staring at a comet through a spyglass. A comely young female, seated in an armchair at the window, is pointing out the phenomenon to the gazer. Meanwhile a youthful gallant, on his knees beside the lady, is squeezing her hand, tenderly pressing her foot, and otherwise striving to enlist her interest by a demonstrative display of affection.
   2 Depiction: A slipshop and tailorlike-looking old scarecrow, with spectacles on nose, and wearing a scarlet nightcap, is viewing with idiotic rapture the advent of a fat, inebriated, and dishevelled bacchante of mature charms, who, with a decanter in one hand and a glass in the other, is staggering into the chamber, to the amusement of a pretty servant-maid outside. The ancient dotard is making a parody on the quotation: "On she came - such as I saw her in my dream. Grease was in all her steps - Geneva in her hand, in every gesture reeling ripe for fun!"
   1 Depiction: A smart sailor of the period, returning to shore with prize money galore, and a watch, chain, and seals in either fob, neat silver shoe-buckles, and a spic-span rig-out, is calling to cash a twenty-pound note on a banker, who is negligently looking at the ceiling. The honest tar, who probably thinks the amount of the draft he has to draw a veritable fortune, is evincing his consideration for the man of finance - "I say, my tight little fellow, I've brought you a Tickler! A draught for twenty pounds, that's all! But don't be downhearted, you shan't stop on my account! I'll give you two days to consider of it."
   1 Depiction: A stalwart-looking bully has suddenly burst into an apartment. He has seized and is securely holding an alarmed individual, whose hat is thrown off and his wig is knocked awry. His pigtail is rigid with terror. He is standing on tiptoe, his limbs paralysed with fear, while a very picturesque-looking Cyprian, with hair and dress in somewhat dishevelled condition, is deliberately exploring the pockets of the victim.
   2 Depiction: A stout Englishman and a group of French ladies and gentlemen, the latter enclosed in one jacket.

   1 Depiction: A stout dowager and her maid are thrown into a state of consternation easy to appreciate by the sudden entrance on the occupations of the toilette of a roystering young "blood", who, from the disorder of his dress and the recklessness of this attitude, has evidently returned from the tavern, something the worse for his evening's potations, and not strikingly clear in his head as to his ultimate destination.
   1 Depiction: A stout equestrienne has put up her steed at the shop of an apothecary, who combines the profession of veterinary surgeon the venerable practitioner, with spectacles on nose, is preparing a diaculum plaster for the scarified horsewoman.

He is lounging on an elegant sofa of the early Georgian period, making inane love to a pretty girl placed by his side, dressed in a picturesque Watteau-like costume, with a quilted petticoat and a quaint mob-cap added. The amorous old trifler's hand is on the slim waist of the beauty. The damsel is standing up in a negligently easy pose while she is toying with her antiquated admirer and waving his enormous and elaborately curled double-tailed wig in the air. A dog is at her side.
   1 Depiction: A suffering mortal is seated at an unfurnished dinner table. The man's hands are clasped, his brows are knit, and his lips tightly closed, in an effort to maintain his patience and his temper under two exasperating provocatives to violence. Placed before the bent-down martyr to domestic infirmities is a phantom bone of mutton presumably the husband has taken exception both to the insufficiency of the joint and the superabundance of smoke, which is eddying round in volumes, and is filling the apartment with dense blackness while his better half, sailing like a fury out of the gloom, is an object to inspire terror in the boldest heart, and the stings of the sharp tongue are apparently even more intimidating than her nails or her knuckles, all of which weapons of offence are enlisted against her pitiable helpmate.
   1 Depiction: A superior officer, going his midnight rounds of the sentries posted on a line of fortifications, is amused at discovering the phenomenon of two pairs of legs below one cloak. A trooper has taken advantage of his ample garment to smuggle in a fair companion to share his vigils. The lady seems to enjoy her situation.
   1 Depiction: A tar of the old school, about to mount a bony steed.
   1 Depiction: A trim nymph, very fashionably dressed, is starting on her travels from a hotel, situated, as we recognize, from the notice on the wall, near Portsmouth Dock. The figure of the promenader is drawn with care, and is perfectly in Rowlandson's most telling manner. Behind the curled, feathered, and blooming damsel, is an ancient and colossal harridan, bedizened with showy finery, who is supposed to have launched the fair charmer. Characteristic glimpses of Portsmouth are given in the background of the picture.
   1 Depiction: A veritable bovine specimen, a fine Alderney, dressed out in the reigning mode. The fore part in female guise, on the head a gigantic hat of the cart-wheel order, straw trimmed and garnished, huge earrings, the extensive muslin "choker" a miniature of a bull round the cow's neck, ladies' buckled shoes, and ribboned sandles on the forelegs, and maccaroni's hessians and tassels on the hind ones.

   1 Depiction: A view in Wales is faithfully pictured. The unsophisticated natives are struck with astonishment at the figure of the travelling artist. Rain, which is now unknown in the Principality, is wrapping the landscape and figures in a moist embrace. The artist's very remarkable umbrella is a poor protection. His hat is limp, For safety his long clay pipe, a luxury difficult to replace, is thrust through a slit in the flap. His lank locks are dripping, the moisture is concentrating, and dropping down his well-defined proboscis. A box contains the artist's larder and wardrobe. His saddle-bags hold the provisions of the hour. Beside him swing his tea-kettle and coffee-pot. His goodly sketchbook is slung across his back.

   1 Depiction: A view of that portion of the racing-ground where the jockeys are about to mount. Various interested groups are represented as surrounding the riders, and secret counsel, at the last moment, is given to jockeys by owners of horses - possibly parting instructions to ride either a winning or a losing race, as their private arrangements may require. That the proceedings of the Turf were not perfectly pure and above the comment of suspicion in the infancy of horse-racing is indicated by the caricaturist in the last action of 'jockeyship.' The riders, while shaking hands finally with their owners and backers, are shown taking care to keep their left hands open behind their backs for bribes from the other side. This signal is meeting a golden response.
   1 Depiction: A view of the Holder Tower in fall.

   1 Depiction: A wretched invalid - propped up in an armchair, without the power to assist himself - has evidently done with the `prescriptions, boluses, and blisters' at his side, since the ranges of physic-bottles which ornament his apartment have, to all appearance, finished the patient's business effectually. He is visited by a corpulent, self-satisfied practitioner, whose hat is under one arm and his cane under the other. Tthe doctor is addressing his unconscious patient: 'My dear sir, you look this morning the picture of health // I have no doubt at my next visit I shall find you utterly cured of all your earthly infirmities.'
   1 Depiction: A young and well-favoured military buck has returned to his house at the advanced and disreputable hour of four o'clock in the morning, as indicated in the title. He has evidently been "making a night of it" and is considerably the worse for his potations. His young and pretty wife, who is in bed, is thrown into a mixed condition between consternation, fear and resentment at the condition of her gallant spouse. The husband is propped up in an armchair, and left to the care of two comely housemaids, who are making efforts to assist this hopeless rake to divest himself of his clothes - an essential preliminary towards going to bed which he is signally unable to perform for himself. He is perfectly helpless in the hands of these wenches, and is contemplating with an imbecile air an empty purse, the result of his evening's recreations.

   1 Depiction: An elopement unexpectedly accelerated.

A rung of the rope-ladder has given way with the weight. At the moment a male relation nightcap on head, is discovering the flight and throwing a light on the subject with a chamber candle which he is holding out of the bedroom window. The partner of the elopement is an officer. He is precipitated on his back, and forms a convenient cushion to receive the lady's fall, which is complete and overwhelming. A postchaise, prepared for the flight, is seen in the distance/ the postilion is enjoying the spectacle of his employer's downfall. And the moon, peeping over a cloud, is represented with a broad grin on its face at the expense of these disconcerted 'fly-by-nights.'
   1 Depiction: An exuberant rustic charmer has been entertaining a fashionable visitor in a granary. A party of rustics, mounting the ladder, have disturbed the interview. A powdered, pig-tailed, and lace-ruffled dandy has sought concealment amidst the sacks of grain. His head appears over the barrier in sheer dismay, for a determined farm-help, probably the legitimate swain of the indignant damsel, armed with a formidable pitch-fork, is making reckless efforts to impale the trespasser. His fury is slightly restrained by the stalwart exertions of the lady, who has buried her fingers in the village Othello's shock head of hair. At his feet is a scroll with the quotation "I smell a rat, dead for a ducat."  A bill, pinned on the wall, set forth "Rats, pole cats, and all sorts of vermin effectively destroyed."

Since she is hastening to the first floor to her niece's apartment. Above the balustrade stands the guilty damsel, who has had sufficient warning, as her lover, carrying his garments in his hand, for expedition, is making his way from the niece's room under the cover of an ambuscade. While the lady is leaning over the staircase railings, with an air of startled innocence assumed to carry off the contretemps.
   1 Depiction: An old country dame has called upon a pedagogue, with a fanciful grievance, to make respectful complaints against the dominie's scholars, who, cap in hand, and satchel on back, are making their entrance into the learned presence, behind their accuser. The schoolmaster, who wears a red nightcap, and slippers, is made to say: have they done to offend you now?' 'Please your honour's worship, they followed me up and down, and said one to another, at her, beat her, damn her, pelt her! and a great deal more that I do not recollect.' The young pupils are explaining the old lady's misconception:  `Indeed, sir, we were only repeating our Greek alphabet in order to get it quite perfect. What the old woman heard was only Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and so on to the conclusion!'

   1 Depiction: Boney, on his arrival in Paris, proceeded to his old quarters in the Tuileries, whence Louis the Eighteenth had but just departed....In the picture we have the streets of Paris represented as being filled with a surging multitude of enthusiasts, while standards, eagles, and heads of enemies are held up on pikes, by the wilder fanatics, as signs of encouragement. Death and the Devil are tempting the Corsican from the balcony of the Tuileries. In 'return for more horrors' and in exchange for 'death and destruction' all that he sees is offered the conqueror. The bony skeleton is pointing out the bargain with his dart, but Time's hourglass is standing unperceived at Napoleon's side and the sand is running forth. The figure of the Devil is resting his arms fraternally on the shoulders of Boney and Marshal Ney and drawing them into an ill-starred embrace. The other marshals and adherents are in the rear. But a marked expression of apprehension is shown on the faces of the entire party, with the exception of the two supernatural visitors, who are grinning at the anticipation of fresh iniquities and increasing deadly horrors, with which they entertain the certain prospect of being gratified by their pet protege.

Napoleon is haranguing in his usual grandiose style: "Rejoice, ye Frenchmen, the fruits of my labour has produced a little image of myself. I shall, for the love I owe your country, instil in my noble offspring the same principles of lying, thieving, treachery, lethery, murder, and all other foul deeds, for which I am now worshipped and adored!"

If capitalism and private property remain, even the most democratic and free countries will be ruled by a small minority of capitalists and the rich. For the first time in history, we have created a government where the true laborers hold all the power in government. We know that the Soviet system cannot instantly cure the ills of the past, but it gives the possibilty of socialism, the chance for the oppressed people to rise and take power and into their own hands. Soviet rule is the first step to socialism, and since it was founded by the mass of workers, it is true and invincible.'

A "foreign nobleman" - that is to say, according to English views at the period - a "speculative Count" who is very splendid in exterior, is evidently a confederate of his countryman, the Italian picture dealer, and has accompanied the noble incipient collector as a decoy to puff the wares, and if need be to offer fictitious sums in opposition to Milford and spur his enthusiasm for the fine arts, which are respectably represented around, as far as good names go. A sensuous Magdalen, attributed to Guido, is exciting the admiration of the party and employing the wily dealer's eloquence. Around are supposititious examples of Rubens, Carracci, Titian, Teniers, Salvator Rosa, and other "undoubted originals," the major part of which in all probability owe their well-disguised paternity to the versatile "Van Daub".

   1 Depiction: On a convenient plot of grass mutes, wandsmen, hearse- drivers, and all the other melancholy functionaries of the last rites of unconscious humanity, are picnicking with a true zest and appreciation of rural freedom. A substantial pie, and other suggestive 'funeral baked meats' are being disposed of to the best advantage. But, excellent trenchermen though the undertakers may prove themselves, their main distinction must rest on their bibulous qualities. The members of the fraternity are applying themselves with hearty goodwill to the fluids, far on the road to becoming 'glorious' while some of the party have already reached their congenial stage 'of half seas over.'

J.B. replies: "If you want to go through pay the toll, what the devil do you think I keep a turnpike gate for?" A crowd of dissenters, quakers, &amp;c. in the Pope's rear, are anxious to enjoy the opportunity: "Though I boast not gaudy trappings," says a quaker, "nor am I mounted on ass-back, yet if he goeth through verily I should like to go through also!" "Verily, so should I."  "We should all like to go through."

In front of that portion of the earth holding the staff is a draped scarf or banner supported by eagles, on the banner are the words 'Napoleon Le grande.'

The foreigner is dressed in a gay military uniform, and has gone to enjoy himself at the theatre. But the eyes of the audience do little else but stare at his uniform. The identity of this bird of passage is not very positive at this date. The plate as a whole, is as characteristic and well-drawn an example of Rowlandson's etchings as can be found.

The hero is armed with a sabre of True Spanish Toledo, and is crying, "True patriotism shall thus subdue the monstrous beast, and quell the rage of war." His shield is Catalonia, a mitre, St. Peter's, Rome, is his helmet. Spanish Patriotism has struck the decisive blow from his right arm. Asturias, his sword- belt is Madrid, his legs Cordova, and with his foot, Cadiz, he is strangling a serpent. The fleet of Admiral Purvis is seen on the seas. Hope, with her anchor, is stooping to catch the crowns of France, Spain and Portugal, which have been shaken from the brow of the smitten beast.

   1 Depiction: Thackeray seated at writing desk, dagger in one hand and quill in the other, club leaning against arm of chair.
   1 Depiction: The "Corsican" is exposed to a worse fate than fell to Belshazzar. His conquests are taken from him, the throne of state is overset, the imperial purple is stripped from his shoulders, the diadem and sceptre have fallen. The sovereignties, crowns, and dignities which were his playthings are swept away. His person is seized by the Father of Evil, who is claiming his due . . . . An arm of vengeance, appearing from the clouds, has effectually paralysed the faculties of the conscience-smitten conqueror . . . .
   1 Depiction: The "Water Works" built in 1769-1800 from designs by Benjamin Latrobe, used until 1815 and demolished between 1827-28.
   1 Depiction: The Annunciation.
   1 Depiction: The Athenian Weaver, Bottom, watching the dance of Titania.
   1 Depiction: The Austrian army is drawn up in security on one side of the river Danube. Buonaparte, in a fine rage with his discomfited generals, and his disappointed legions, are arrayed on the other bank, powerless to disturb their exulting adversaries. The Emperor is pointing to the remains of his famous bridge, and furiously demanding, in reply to the Austrian taunts: 'Ah, who is it that dares contradict me, I say it was some floating timber and the high swell of the river that caused the shocking accident!' An impolitic old general, bowing low, and in consternation at the news he is obliged to impart, is replying: 'With all due deference to your little Majesty, it was the Austrian fire-boats that destroyed the bridge.' The Arch-duke's troops are chanting a new edition of an old nursery rhyme: 'Boney's bridge is broken down, Dance over the Lady Lee // Boney's bridge is broken down   By an Archduke--ee.'
   1 Depiction: The Beast, which has sprung from Corsica, is drawn with seven heads. The names of Austria, Naples, Holland, Denmark, Prussia and Russia are on the respective crown. The seventh head, which is of course that of Napoleon, is severed from the trunk, while vomiting forth flames. The distance shows cities on fire, where the beast has wrought destruction. On his body are the figures 666, the total of the numerals found in the name of Napoleon Buonaparte added together, taking a as one, i as ten, t as a hundred, and so on.
   1 Depiction: The Champion is clad in a complete suit of mail, and he is valorously rushing up to the mouth of the cavern, whence the Hydra is breaking forth. It must be confessed that the Champion seems a little staggered at the front displayed by the many-headed monster. The foremost and most overgrown head is that of the Commander-in- Chief, begirt with the Collar of Corruption. The other heads are described by their collars: Dowler, Sandon, Dr. O'Meara, Dr. Donovan, Mrs. Clarke, and Master Carter.
   1 Depiction: The Chancellor of the Exchequer is literally extinguishing Fortune, who is represented as a comely and youthful winged female holding a well-filled purse in one hand and a lottery prize for L2000 in the other. At her feet are caskets of gems and jewels. She is seated on well-filled sacks, behind her is the wheel of fortune.
   1 Depiction: The Corsican fox, who is still at large, has turned his tail on certain rich vines heavy with ripe Spanish grapes, which are growing beside fine prolific Portuguese plum-trees. The fox, who bears Napoleon's head, with his inevitable huge ...
   1 Depiction: The Corsican fox, who is still at large, has turned his tail on certain rich vines heavy with ripe Spanish grapes, which are growing beside fine prolific Portuguese plum-trees. The fox, who bears Napoleon's head, with his inevitable huge cocked hat, is speciously trying to convince the Gallic cock that the fruit which he cannot reach, is not worth gathering. "Believe me, my dear doodle-do, you would not like them. I found them so sour that I absolutely could not touch them!" This excuse is not satisfactory to the hearer, "But, my good friend, you promised to bring me home some Spanish grapes and Portugal plums, where are they?"
   1 Depiction: The Corsican, who had faced and conquered Fate on so many fields of battle, is at length confronted with the grim foe under circumstances which lend additional terrors to his proximity....Rowlandson represents the Corsican in a fit of despondency, forlorn and abstracted, seated on a drum in an attitude of dejection, with his head between his hands, staring in the face of the King of Terrors, of whose close company he is seemingly too self-occupied to take much heed. The grim destroyer, as the skeleton Death, is watching the baffled general face to face, assuming a parody of his attitude, and seated on a gun, with a broken eagle standard at his bony feet. The Russian, Austrian, Prussian, Bavarian and other allied armies are streaming along in unbroken hosts, scattering the dismayed legions of France, and making havoc amidst the ranks of the discouraged Grand Army, which is melting away before the combined forces.
   1 Depiction: The Corsican, who is represented as both prematurely aged and haggard, is sprawled, spread-eaglewise, on the ground. Upon him is a formidable harrow, which is kept in its place by the obese figure of a traditional Hollander, who is leisurely smoking with his hands in his pockets and an Orange favour in his hat, in philosophic indifference to the situation and sufferings of the victim, who is exclaiming, "Oh! this heavy Dutchman! Oh! had I not enough to bear before!!!"
   1 Depiction: The Defeat of the High &amp; Mighty Bailissimo Corbettino and his famed Cecilian Forces on the Plains of St. Martin on Thursday the 3rd day of February 1785 by the Champion of the People and his chosen Band after a smart Skirmish which lasted a considerable time in which many Men were lost on both sides. But their great ally at length losing ground. Desertions took place and notwithstanding their great superiority in Numbers and weight of Metal at the first onset they decreased apace altho often rallied by ablest Men in Command, till at length the Forces gave way in all quarters and they were totally overthrown. This Print is dedicated to the Electors of the City &amp; Liberty of Westminster who have so nobly stood forth and supported their Champion upon this trying occasion by An Independent Elector'.
   2 Depiction: The Diligence is starting from a massively built and handsome innyard, the sign of the Coq en Pate. The "machine" is a cumbersome vehicle, clumsy and heavy to an incredible degree. It is drawn . . . By four strong, long, ill-favoured steeds, harnessed with ropes to the Noah's Ark-like contrivance, and ridden by two postillions, who are cracking their long thonged whips without producing much acceleration of speed in the toiling team . . . . A huge basket in front, about the size of a porter's lodge, is presumably the "luggage boot." Below this are two small and heavy wheels, while at the other end of the machine are two enormous hind-wheels.
   1 Depiction: The Duchess of Devonshire has taken to her arms the person of a fat and greasy butcher, whom she is favoring with a salute in the zeal of patriotism. Another fair canvasser, (possibly the Duchess of Gordon), rejoicing in proportions more expanded than those of the beautiful Georgiana, is seconding the proceeding. While shouting "Huzza, Fox for ever!," a lusty butcher, with his tray under his arm, is cheering and hurrying up to share his possible reward.
   1 Depiction: The Duke (of York's) most affectionate epistles were dated from Weymouth, and ... the stout commander is seated at table there, pen in hand, filled with rapture at the prospect of returning to his Delilah ... The Duke's black footboy, who is standing staring in amazement at the rhapsodizing hero, his master, is inclined to moralize over the Duke's follies. An Unexpected Meeting. An elderly officer is amazed at running across the figure of Mrs. Clarke's footboy, strutting in his uniform as bold as the best. us at the house of a lady of a certain description!' The promoted favourite is highly indignant at this allusion to the past: 'I beg, sir, you will not come for to go to affront a gemman!'
   1 Depiction: The Duke of Leinster is crying, 'Aye, my lads, Dr. Willis has done the King over, and the Regent won't take it!' Other members of the deputation are remarking, 'The English lads were so merry, by my shoul, they were always alaughing at us! Ambassadors Extraordinary, by St. Patrick, but I've forgot what we have done!--Done? Why carried the address, and brought it back again, with all these cakes. A deal better than potatoes!'
   1 Depiction: The Duke of York is following the example of the famous slayer of Philistines. He is sunk in slumber, with his head on the lap of his treacherous Delilah.... Mrs. Clarke.... has taken advantage of the hero's unconsciousness to chop off his full pigtail, and she is holding up the severed caudal appendage, as an encouragement to the enemies of the helpless Commander-in-Chief to take advantage of their opportunity......
   1 Depiction: The Duke of York's head is placed on the shoulders of the disabled forest king, a pair of asses are showing their heels to the royal beast....  Another ass, of deeper cunning, forbears to take advantage of the prostrate lion, from far-seeing motives. 'Pshaw, pshaw! don't be afraid, I shall not kick, you may depend upon me - you may be of service to me hereafter!'.....
   1 Depiction: The Duke of York, arrayed in his canonicals as Prince Bishop of Osnabruck, has turned his back on his mansion and on his wife: he has travelled a long stride upon the 'road to destruction' and passed the `stumbling-block' on his path. He is trampling under foot 'Thoughts on Connubial Happiness' and the Commandments, and is just turning the corner of Gloucester Place, saying, 'Now for a meeting with my dearest dear.' Mrs. Clarke and a female friend are looking out of window, and signalling the Duke's arrival.
   1 Depiction: The Duke of York, in his regimentals, has gone down on his knees to the latest wonder of the hour, and is beseeching the popular arrival to divert the minds of an excitement-loving people from his own particular case.
   1 Depiction: The Dutch lion surrounded by ambassadors on a beach. Figures are numbered with an explanation pasted on verso of print.
   1 Depiction: The Emperor Napoleon, dressed in the simple and familiar habit by which his figure is best recognized, the little cocked hat, the green coat, buttoned across the chest, the white waistcoat and breeches, is tearing his hardest towards "Maynz" and the Rhine. A frightened hare, suggestive of the Imperial courage, is scampering before him and marking the way. The "little corporal" carries, instead of a walking-stick, the effigy of the great Emperor of Germany, Carolus Magnus, at the head of a pole. On his back is a pack, from which the various collections he had previously gathered are suffered to escape: Italy, Holland, Switzerland, Rheinland, Hanstat Department, Poland. Paper prints of soldiers, Alte Garde and Junge Garde are blowing away and being left behind in the flight.
   1 Depiction: The Emperor is left unsupported, in the hands of his enemies, now turned into tormentors. Hhe is thrown into a blanket and tossed up into the air, and is suffering worse discomforts than did Sancho Panza under a similar infliction: crown, sceptre, and sword are shaken off ... John Bull (whose wig and hat have been thrown aside), the Dutch Mynheer, and Spanish Don are performing wonders with their side of the blanket. Then come the Cossack, the Pope, the Pole, the Prince Imperial of Austria, the Emperors of Russia and Austria and the Kings of Prussia, Hanover, and Wurtemburg, who are all lending a hand to torment the Corsican.
   1 Depiction: The Emperor, with a halter around his neck and handcuffed to his brother Joe, is being led by General Blucher. Kings of various countries dancing around a flag pole.
   1 Depiction: The Emperor, with all the bombast, bravado, and speciousness of which he had an excellent command, has summoned a meeting of his faithful subjects and supporters - who, judging from the expression of their faces, appear but an unwilling and disaffected audience - in order to present his infant son to the people. The scion of the great captain is dressed in a miniature uniform, with a long sabre trailing on the ground, and a gold stick, which he is trying to fancy is a riding horse....The Corsican is vaporing on a grand scale, trying ineffectually to raise the ardour of his dupes: "Did I not swear I would destroy Austria? Did I not swear I would destroy Prussia" etc. etc.
   1 Depiction: The French army, carrying firearms, clashes with the saber-wielding Mamluks in front of the Egyptian pyramids.
   1 Depiction: The French troops blast the Austrian army with artillery.
   1 Depiction: The Hypochondriac is seated in his arm-chair, in night-cap and slippers, and wrapped in a flannel dressing-gown, his arms are folded and his head droops, in melancholy meditation, on his chest. The expression of his features is moody in the extreme. By his side is an iron-clamped chest, to hint that the sufferer is somewhat tenacious of his wealth, although his life has otherwise become insupportably burdensome. Phantoms and figurative horrors of various descriptions, are haunting the invalid'd diseased mind.... A table is covered with Doctor's Stuff, and a well-fed and prosperous charlatan in attendance on the distempered patient, is in consultation with a pretty waiting-maid, whose face and person give indications of the most flourishing health - a palpable contrast to the sufferer on whom she is retained to attend.
   1 Depiction: The Ladder of John Climacus.
   1 Depiction: The Manet painting, "Dejeuner sur l'Herbe" appears in the background of the cartoon.
   1 Depiction: The Old House is seemingly in a bad way. The foundation is Public Credit. The Funds, represented as a grilled gate, are secured with a huge padlock. The Royal Crown and Sceptre are placed on a block, and marked for sale. Seated on another block, labelled Protector, sits the fox, guarding the Treasury. Around his waist is a chain secured to the Coalition-pillar, which is depicted as rather a twisted support . . . . Since the old building is overweighted and crushed with a mass of Taxes, piled on the roof, the accumulated pressure of "the accursed ten years" American war, formented by the Opposition and misconducted by a timid Minister.
   1 Depiction: The Park, with its mixed crowd of fashionable promenaders and pleasure-seekers, has afforded the designer ample scope for the delineation of both grotesque and graceful figures, modishly apparelled. Characteristic of the earlier Georges, the younger branches rushed into all the latest innovations - costumes which are generally received as distinctive of the end of the last and the beginning of the present century. Thus to the observer of the picturesque the fashions of 1784 offered the external habits of two distinct epochs. Among other features, indicative of the introduction of novelties, the artist has represented the parasol, or more properly the umbrella, then an object likely to occasion remark, as its general use was just coming into fashion.
   1 Depiction: The Patna at sea; The Patna at dock; Shipboard scene with man studying chart; Marlow and the narrator on the veranda; Man in ship cabin looks through open door at man standing near ship rail.
   1 Depiction: The Pied Piper, leading the children from their home town into the cave.
   1 Depiction: The Pied piper, leading the children from their home town into the cave. Beneath the drawing, in the margin, is another sketch of the Piper.
   1 Depiction: The Pope is kneeling by his side, and pronouncing by way of benediction over the infant: "The owl shriek'd at thy birth, an evil sight // The night-crow cry'd, foreboding luckless time // Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempests shook down trees // The raven rock's her on the chimney-top, And chattering pies in dismal discord aung."
   1 Depiction: The University Auditorium.
   1 Depiction: The advent of a nondescript animal, suppositiously assumed to be a ferocious mad dog, has produced the utmost terror and confusion amongst the grave frequenters of a mercantile coffee-house. All the city brokers, and pillars of exchange found therein, are scared out of their sober senses. Some, like the little Jew in the corner, are paralysed with fear. Others are trying to creep under the tables. A few are seeking escape by the door, which they are effectually blocking, and groups of affrighted fugitives are endeavoring to gain the refuge of the staircase.
   1 Depiction: The adventures of Father Lantimeche who loses his money.
   1 Depiction: The adventures of a hawker of vegetables and her faithful donkey, in a series of six cuts, illustrating the invaluable qualities of the quadruped. The composition commences thus: "hurricane and rain // While I my daily bread did gain? Strain".
   2 Depiction: The affecting scene is taking place outside the Prince of Wale's residence; his Royal Highness is watching the departure of his friend from the window. Fox is mounted on a patient ass, ready to ride the road to 'Coventry' the High Baliff, having unlawfully refused to make his return until the conclusion of the scrutiny which Sir Cecil Wray thought proper to investigate, the caricaturist hints that, for the time the Whig leader will be `left out in the cold' until the question of his return is finally settled.
   1 Depiction: The ages of man from 5 months to 100 years. In verse.
   1 Depiction: The auctioneer is in his pulpit, employed in knocking down an assortment of vehicles to a small but sufficiently eccentric- looking audience.  A gouty individual, propped on crutches, is making a bid for an antiquated kind of cabriolet, which the groom is trotting up for inspection. Around are curricles, travelling carriages and a general assemblage of the machines on wheels representative of the past.
   2 Depiction: The bare and chilling chamber is occupied by a leaden-hued and sordid-looking miser, opposite to whom is seated an individual of starved aspect. A pinched and shrivelled old beldame is seen at the door. A table of interest is the only literature the room can boast. Candle for economy . . . .
   1 Depiction: The barrack-room is extensive, and handsomely decorated with trophies of weapons, which, with a suit of mail, are disposed on the walls with a good eye to effect. The officers are rising and dressing for morning parade. An officer, the principal features of whose countenance are absorbed in a pair of huge moustachios, is seated on the regimental drum, while a pretty girl is employed unromantically in trimming the warrior's toenails. A soldier- barber is a the same time dressing the hero's locks and binding up his monstrous pigtail, which reaches over a yard in length.
   1 Depiction: The battle for Alexandria. French soldiers have surrounded the city, which is full of smoke from the artillery.
   2 Depiction: The beadel of a provision market, who has laid hands on the barrow of a seller of black puddings, has been seized by the nose, in a fashion to blind both eyes at once, by a muscular female, to whom the overturned barrow belongs. Her stalwart right arm and massive fist at the same time are making energetic play on the person of the discomfited functionary, who has become, from some act of interference on his part, the centre of a general attack. A dog is threatening his legs, and a hag is belabouring his rear with her basket. Butchers and poulterers' men are enjoying the diversion.
   1 Depiction: The body of Christ is being laid in the tomb; angels mourn him in sky.
   1 Depiction: The body of the departed wife is laid out in her coffin, propped on trestles. On the plate let into the lid is engraved the above affecting lines. The lamenting spouse is far gone in a mixed state of grief, intoxication, and maudlin affection. He is making laudable efforts to resign himself to his recent bereavement, and is endeavoring to allay his sorrow, between the combined consolations of drink and the tender solicitudes of a favorite maid, who is exerting herself to administer comfort to her afflicted master, with her arm round his neck.
   1 Depiction: The building of Columbia College.
   1 Depiction: The calendar has for each month a photograph of one of the buildings on the campus.
   1 Depiction: The chamber is alive with motion, and it is evidently the accustomed method of departure. Pairs of dogs are rushing about, huntsmen and grooms are carrying saddles on their heads and making preparations for the start. The remains of last night's relaxations, in the shape of pipes and mugs of ale, are still uncleared, and the articles scattered around, guns, saddles, whips, hunting-horns, and fox- skins, attest the pronounced sporting tastes of the country squire. A pretty child is tranquilly sleeping, in its cradle, undisturbed by the bustle of the hunter's early start.
   1 Depiction: The character De La Jabardiere standing beside wagon, eating bread and drinking water from fountain; emaciated dog tied to wagon, lapping up water from fountain.
   1 Depiction: The children of workers are shown living and playing in modern apartment houses with playgrounds and kindly adults to supervise them.
   1 Depiction: The consulting-room of a learned physician. An imposing bookcase fills the background.  The doctor's man has just shown up a comfortable looking couple, who have called for the benefit of the physician's advice. The practitioner is one of the old school, full-bottomed wig, powder, and pigtail, a learnedly long-skirted square-cut suit, lace frill and ruffles, huge spectacles, and a professional gold-headed cane held up to the nose. He is standing on the hearthrug warming his learned back at the fireplace. Above the mantlepiece is a bust of Galen.
   1 Depiction: The contributaries to this monument of turpitude are grouped together to form a memorial suited to the occasion. The foundation-stone is a huge block labelled "York Folly", supported on one side by the Episcopal mitre and crozier of the Right Rev. Bishop of Osnabruck, with a scroll of "The New Morality." The accessories on the other side are the cocked-hat, sword and tender love-letters of the ex-Commander-in-Chief. A block of "Cracked Portland Stone" and a third slab of   "Folkstone of the first quality' refer to the agitations raised by the Duke of Portland and Lord Folkstone. The more spirited elements are ranged above this foundation, in the form of a barrel of 'Whitebread's Entire", "Burdett's Stingo", and "Wardle's British Spirit", these gentlemen having been the most active in enforcing the Duke's resignation.
   1 Depiction: The corporal has incautiously been paying a visit to a fine damsel. The lady is snugly disposing her lover in a strong-box. An old "salt" bristling with indignation is looking in at the window.
   1 Depiction: The death of Washington is lamented by Columbia and Fame.
   1 Depiction: The departing Commander-in-Chief, in his regimentals, as he is invariably represented, is trying to harrow John Bull's sympathies before he deprives him of his valuable services....The good-natured national prototype is keeping up a show of affliction under the approaching bereavement. Although he is concealing his face with his handkerchief, a smile lurks round the corner of his mouth…
   1 Depiction: The depicted artist is believed to be a self-portrait of the Masanobu. The character on his back reads "long life" (ju).
   1 Depiction: The devotions of Old Avarice, which are necessarily very profound and earnest, are offered appropriately at the feet of his divinity, "Plutus, God of Riches." The temple of wealth is not exteriorly sumptuous. The carpet is a rag. A strong box, a broken chair, and a rushlight make up the sordid furniture. The miser is confessing that he possesses nine houses, estates in Essex, mortgages in Hertford, large landed speculations in Russell Square and the neighborhood, reversions of estates, trading ventures, "Mermaid" sloop, funded property, Government securities, &amp;c. &amp;c. he is beseeching an increase of his means, success to his investments, and a rise in the "Stocks'.
   1 Depiction: The direst disorder is proceeding around on all sides. The conflict of fists, aided by such aggressive articles as bottles, the fireirons, and any offensive weapon that may come to hand, is raging free and furious. The president of this harmonic meeting is very naturally employing his hammer to bring the turbulent to order, by using it as an instrument to knock down his opponents. Wigs are sent flying "through" space. Chairs are wrecked: decanters, spirit-bottles, punchbowls, and such frail objects as tumblers, rummers, and wine-glasses, are involved in universal destruction. One elated youthful hero has jumped on the table in a tipsy frolic, he is promoting the further confusion which darkness will entail by deliberately smashing up the candles, and battering the sconces of the chandelier with the assistance of a punch-ladle.
   1 Depiction: The disconsolate sinner, with hard peas in his shoes is crawling along, doubled up with agony, to the shrine at Loretto, meeting half-way the joyful pilgrim, who has accomplished his penance, "whitewashed his soul" and returned from his journey without personal inconvenience by the exercise of the simplest precaution, as he confesses: "To walk a little more at ease, I took the liberty to boil my peas!"
   1 Depiction: The domestic felicity of well-to-do citizens being rudely broken in upon by robbers and threatening assassins. A very critical situation for all the actors concerned. Much depends upon the first shot--it is truly a moment of suspense. Whether the horse-pistols of the burglars will miss fire, and the formidable blunderbuss held by the respectable householder will lodge its contents - which would be, seemingly, enough to mow down a regiment - in the dastardly bodies of the midnight marauders, must remain a problem, the solution of which is lost beyond recovery.
   1 Depiction: The domestic horizon is clouded by storms. The late happy pair are only kept from demolishing each other by the table placed between them, which is being wrecked in the struggle. The wife, in a fury, is holding on to her husband's hair with all her force, while he has a firm grasp of his unfortunate spouse's head, at which he is aiming a pewter pot. Children, chairs, crockery, cutlery, and food, are alike devoted to destruction. The infants are frantic, and general misery prevails. The execution of these subjects is commonplace, and the engraver has not done justice to the originals.
   1 Depiction: The easel is folded up on the back of the stumpy pony. Brushes, a palette knife, flasks of oil of goodly proportions, and a palette of extensive dimensions are attached to the animal's neck, and thus equipped, the man of paint and his rough steed are picking a devious way through the saturating moisture up and down the steep mountains of the country. It is suggested that the large and gaunt limner, with his strongly outlined features, and with his long legs slung across a Welch pony, may offer some points of resemblance to the designer.
   1 Depiction: The enthusiasm with which the return of "Boney" was hailed, from his landing in France till his arrival in the capital, and the devoted reception he encountered from his old followers, are made the subjects of more than one travesty. In the present case the head and bust of the Emperor, on a colossal scale - his throat encircled by a hangman's noose - is elevated on an immense pyramid of human heads, his decapitated victims. A brace of demons are flying through the air to encircle the brow of this apostle of freedom with a crown of blazing pitch. A ring of excited demons, with horns, claws, hoofs and tails, but bearing the heads and faces of Napoleon's supporters, are dancing in triumph around the idol they have replaced. From labels attached to the ropes which surround the throttles of these enthusiastic Bonapartists we discover the so-called "Hell Hounds" to be Marshals Ney, Lefebre, Davoust, Vandamme, Savery, Caulincourt, with Fouche, and others.
   1 Depiction: The episode presented in this picture is the complete reverse of that shown in the companion plate Four O'Clock in Town. While the London rake is being assisted to his late bed the country Nimrod is rising with the dawn. The enthusiast for the chase has tumbled out of his early couch. His clothes are hastily thrown on in the partial light of daybreak, and he is, while still half- asleep, making terrific exertions to draw on his boots. His wife, who has not had time to commence her toilette, and who, evidently, will resume her interrupted repose on the departure of the hunting party, is standing, exactly as she has left her bed, with a bottle of cordial and a glass, pouring out a nip of comfort to keep out the cold, for the benefit of her sporting spouse.
   1 Depiction: The exiled general is reduced from his state. He is meanly travelling Elbawards, and has reached the seashore, whence he is to embark for his island residence. A gibbet by the way, with a rope in readiness, is serving as a fingerpost to point the road. Vultures, which fly around this suggestive object, express a desire to pick the bones of the retiring 'carcass butcher.' All the splendours of 'Boney's surroundings are stripped bare. He is riding on a rough-coated donkey, and wearing a 'fool's cap' in place of a crown. His only provision is a bag of brown bread. His consort, loose and ragged, is seated at the crupper on the same beast, which is being unmercifully flogged with a stick labelled 'Baton Marechal.' 'Boney' is lost in terror. His juvenile heir, lately made King of Rome, is preceding the cortege, mounted on a 'Corsican dog.'
   1 Depiction: The fair members of a well-to-do family are seated at table. The elder is reading the news of the Corsican's last outrages: 'They write from Hanover that when Boneyparte took possession of that country he ravished all the women.' 'Oh, the wretch!' cries an old maid. A less antiquated lady is giving her fair neighbor the comforting assurance, 'It's very true, ma'am: it's only a word and a blow with him: your honor or your property.' 'Well, ma'am,' declares a buxom creature, 'if he should come here, at all events I'll take care of my property.' To which a budding maiden is adding, 'So will I, mamma.'
   1 Depiction: The festivities represented, which partake of the free and frolicsome description, are taking place in the servants' hall. Full drinking has been the order of the evening. The master's cellar and the servants' heads have both been lightened simultaneously, and the results are displaying themselves under the mistletoe and in horseplay. A footman and a parlour maid are falling over one another indiscriminately on the hearth-rug amidst the fragments of crockery demolished in their downfall. A sturdy black footman is lifting a fat wench in his arms for a chaste salute. Practical joking is the order of the evening, the fat cook has been toppled back in her armchair, and is vainly flourishing her basting ladle to drive off her assailant, while her feet are in the air. The butler, as author of the mischief, is making the best use of his opportunities, while another couple are exchanging kisses with evident goodwill.
   1 Depiction: The figure of a fop, walking to the delicacies.
   1 Depiction: The figures of two distinguished foreigners, as imported into this country over a century ago, for the delectation of the cognoscendi and the leaders of high taste. A pair of over-dressed Italian artists, extravagantly posturing to one another in some operatic scene. A spindle-shanked signor, hat in hand, is pouring out his ardour to an affected and modish prima donna in a love-making situation, outrageously burlesqued.
   1 Depiction: The finding of Moses on a large overdoor decoration; vibrant coloration.
   1 Depiction: The following poets are represented in this collection--Wendell Berry, Philip Booth, Amy Clampitt, Alfred Corn, Robert Creeley, Edward Dorn, Allen Ginsberg, Louise Gluck, Jorie Graham, Emily Grosholz, Daniel Halpern, Michael Harper, Robert Hass, Andrew Hudgins, Robert Kelly, C. Kizer, Philip Levine, William Meredith, James Richardson, James Schuyler, Delmore Schwartz, Charles Simic, Gary Snyder, William Stafford, Diane Wakoski, Reed Whittemore, C.K. Williams, and Charles Wright.
   1 Depiction: The four characters are The Vigilant Housekeeper, The Amiable Lady's Maid, The Faithful Butler, and The Honest Coachman 2 copies
   1 Depiction: The frog is seen driving the unique coach which is drawn by a number of mice. Below the sketch, is another smaller sketch of the coach.
   1 Depiction: The front door of Mrs. Clarke's establishment, Warren Street. Hung out sign-fashion, bears the quotation: "All the world's a stage, and men and women merely players. Some play the upper, some the under part, but chief play that most foreign to their heart." Colonel Wardel, wrapped in his military cloak, and indicating discretion, with his finger on his lips, is handing a bag of money to a waiting-maid and saying, "You understand me" to which the favourite is replying with an assurance "that the Colonel's business shall be attended to." Mrs. Clarke, leaning out of a window, is over-looking her visitor and crying "Though not in love, enter quick, my guardian angel, my sweet Widdle-Waddle."
   1 Depiction: The front page of the folio has the program for the celebration of the completion of the Bunker Hill monument in 17 June, 1843.
   1 Depiction: The full-page drawings include Temple of Jupiter, Parthenon &amp; Acropolis, Temple of Nike Apteros, Temple at Sunium, Venice, Madonna del Sasso Locarno, and others
   1 Depiction: The fun of the Fair is represented in full swing, and the humors of the scenes displayed on all sides are seized and hit-off with the usual felicity of both artists.
   1 Depiction: The gallant admiral and his chosen captains are raised above the crowd on deck they are, like true British tars of the old school, encouraging the esprit de corps which the hero perfectly understood, since he was able, so far as the sea-lions who served under him were concerned, to cultivate it to such unmeasurable advantage for the honour of his country. The brave tars of all denominations, are thoroughly enjoying themselves after their own hearts, while commemorating the immortal victory of Aboukir Bay, and with each successive bumper are toasting their idol, who is set in their midst, and drinking success and glory to the navy of Old England, and confusion to her enemies - patriotic sentiments to which one and all were prepared to give practical effect in the hour of action.
   1 Depiction: The gallant son of Mars has been quartered on a prosperous farmer, who loves good cheer and brave company. The corporal is made welcome at bed and board, and the best in the house is prepared for his delectation. The venerable Hawbuck does ...
   1 Depiction: The gallant son of Mars has been quartered on a prosperous farmer, who loves good cheer and brave company. The corporal is made welcome at bed and board, and the best in the house is prepared for his delectation. The venerable Hawbuck does not, however, seem pleased with the way his guest is carrying on with his buxom daughter, who is but too clearly smitten with the soldier's charming freedoms and his fine feathers. It is more than the parent bargained for, and even his dog is looking on in astonishment. But the scandalized parent and the young rustic lounging in the doorway, possibly an acknowledged sweet-heart, are at a discount. Their authority is likely to be set at defiance.
   1 Depiction: The head of George the Third, as the sun, is throwing its brilliant rays across the Channel, and shining on the British Fleet which lines the waters. The head of Napoleon Bounaparte, with his cocked hat and feather, is represented as a comet with a fiery train, which is making vicious exertions to dash itself across the orb of day. His eye is following the course of the erratic meteor. "Ay, ay, Master Comet, you may attempt your peri-heliums, or your devil-heliums for what I care, but take the word of an old man, you'll never reach the sun, depend upon it."
   1 Depiction: The head of Napoleon appears as the centre of the constellation, Polar Star, elevated, in this case, like that of a traitor, on a pole, and surrounded by entwined and hissing serpents. Two escutcheons, marked Heart of Tyrant and Vulture with scourges and pronged forks. The pole is elevated on the great globe. In either corner is a French eagle, above the Imperial ensigns are pikes, axes, and standards, "flags manufactured for the Empress" &amp;c. The lustre of the constellation, Napoleon, is likely to suffer an eclipse from the sudden descent of a Dutch comet - a philosophic Hollander, seated astride on a barrel of Hollands Schiedam, the contents of which he is ignominiously discharging over the head of the solitary star of the firmament, etc.
   1 Depiction: The highway, near Gadshill with Prince Henry, Poins, Falstaff, Gadshill, Bardolph, and Peto.
   1 Depiction: The home of the Law School. This view shows in part the McIntire open air Amphitheatre.
   2 Depiction: The husband buys peas that the wife does not cook well, so the husband fights with the grocer.
   1 Depiction: The infant Shakespeare surrounded by his creations of tragedy and comedy, and many others coming to him from over the hills in the distance.
   1 Depiction: The interior of an eating-house in the city. A tall, well- formed and comely waitress is bringing in the dinner of a wicked old reprobate, who is leering his admiration of her personal attractions. Their meals in the various boxes, are turning their heads to gloat over the charms of this favoured handmaiden, who is followed by a 'help' carrying pots of beer for the various customers.
   1 Depiction: The king, in the form of a plump money bag, is anointed with "stand oil" by high priests; John Rockefeller stands behind the king; Andrew Carnegie and John Pierpont Morgan hold the king's robe.
   1 Depiction: The large wood engravings on this sheet illustrate the newspaper’s extensive coverage of foreign news, offering scenes of the Second Italian War for Independence (also called the Franco-Austrian War). There are also portraits of Giuseppe Garibaldi, Adolphe Niel, Patrice MacMahon, and Alexander von Humboldt.
   1 Depiction: The larger page has a Christmas theme, a manger scene, a couple dancing in the background, scenes of revelry.
   1 Depiction: The lately created nobleman, a coarse and common clothier, is swaggering in all his new finery, to give his past associates a taste of his new-found honours. His showy court dress is assumed with awkward pretension. He wears a ribbon and star and a dress sword. None of these decorations harmonise with the wearer, who is so evidently out of place in his fine feathers, that the journeymen tailors and cobblers, his neighbors and recent comrades, are jeering at his burlesque dignity. His lady dressed in unbecoming finery, and carrying a large plume of feathers on her head, looks no less "out of character" than does her tailoring spouse. The shop, over which appears, Stitchall, White-chapel, Breeches cleaned and repaired, once the pride of the pair, is now closed . . . .
   1 Depiction: The letter "C" at right of man's head on bird's body with "A, B, C, D, E, F, G" on stomach; the letter "B" at left of man's head on bird's body holding palette.
   1 Depiction: The low cottages of some hamlet are partly distinguishable through the prodigious clouds of dust raised by the unruly eccentricities of a pleasure-party, represented as taking the air in three over-laden and ramshackle carts, drawn by wretched horses barely one remove from the knacker's yard. The amusement of the moment is an extemporized race. One cart is leading triumphantly/ the horse is dashing along, urged on by the bludgeon of a coster-monger, who is conducting a party of beauties from St. Gile's, of the most florid and degage type. Cart number two is considerably overmanned/ the horse is down. The driver is alternately trying to whip his horse into animation or to lash his antagonists.
   1 Depiction: The members, who are studying from the nude, are all well advanced in years. The seats and drawing-stands of the old Life Academy are arranged in a horseshoe. The first or inner row of students being seated while those who form the outer semicircle are standing at their easels. An agreeable and graceful-looking female is posed beneath the reflectors in an easy attitude which she is preserving with the assistance of a looped rope slung from the roof.
   2 Depiction: The miseries consequent on heat and crowding in the Pidgeon-Hole Gallery of John Kemble's Newly constructed Drury-Lane Theatre.
   1 Depiction: The new Empress is in a fierce passion, wreaking her vengeance on all around. Tallyrand is levelled with the floor by a blow from the sceptre. A marshall is seeking refuge behind the curtains. The little Emperor is dodging behind an armchair. The Empress is threatening to hurl the Imperial crown at her intimidated lord and master.....The coronation throne has the crown knocked off, and, kicked on the floor by this untamable Austrian, are all the conquered diadems of Europe, including the Pope's tiara and the iron crown of Italy.
   2 Depiction: The nonchalant pair are pledging one another amorously in bumpers, while the spirit of the founder of the feast is departing. A painting of Democritus, his face waring an expression of grief on one side, and laughter on the other, explains the transitory nature of sorrow, and the key of the situation is further offered by certain lines inscribed on a paper under the lady's hand: "Come what may, the cat will mew, the dog will have his day."
   1 Depiction: The occupancy of the Spanish throne has not proved, if we may trust the print, a profitable sinecure of long duration. King Joseph is rushing away from his new dignity as fast as his legs will carry him. The crown has slipped off in the flight. The fugitive's invincible standards and 'Legions of Honour' are in tatters, but the hands of the Frenchmen are not empty. King, officers and troops are all loaded with bags of plate and bullion....
   1 Depiction: The occupants of the rest of the private boxes are of a ruffianly type. Big sticks and publican's pewter measures are noticeable, besides gentlemen with damaged optics and without coats. A great dog, ladies from St. Gile's, and similarly distinguished members of society. A scene of quarrelling, practical joking, and general uproar is proceeding below.
   1 Depiction: The occupants of two waterside crafts are exchanging courtesies on the river . . . . The boatmen in the respective wherries are bawling at one another, and a stout damsel is extending, in expressive pantomime, an invitation which has shocked the proprieties of the occupants of the other craft, a lady of ton in a gay hat and feathers, and a very prim old gentleman, who is looking rigid with horror and indignation.
   1 Depiction: The officers are leaving the vulgar jollifications of Grog on Board for delicate flirtations over the tea-table on shore. In those days, when opportunities for personal distinction were more frequent, commanders were recognised and entertained as heroes, and their visits on shore were not infrequently a round of agreeable festivals and social triumphs...... The head of the house, who is not apparently of the slightest consequence on this occasion, is left to indifference and the charge of the tea urn......
   2 Depiction: The old Cockney hunt is in full swing. The hounds are streaming over some palings in the way of their run. A poor little huntsman, perched upon a white mare, in attempting the jump has lost his whip, missed his seat, and is being thrown over the neck of his horse, while a spirited belle is leaping her horse in true sportsmanlike style.
   1 Depiction: The old drinking-well at Tunbridge. A body of sailors, true British tars, find themselves, by some queer chance, at the well-known watering-place, and what is more mysterious, these sons of Neptune are in close proximity to the Springs. A comely, well-favoured, and smartly attired young damsel, the ministering nymph of the fountain is presenting a tumbler of the fluid, drawn by her own fair hands, to a sturdy ancient coxwain. Another hardy tar is grappling with the distasteful difficulty and making frightful attempts to swallow the contents of his tumbler, but a good proportion of the water is split on the ground. Another smart sailor has his tumbler all safe in his keeping, but he is bribing a diminutive native, who is complacently staring at the prospective drinker, to run and fetch something to qualify the cup.
   1 Depiction: The opening night of Drury-Lane theatre.
   1 Depiction: The patients, who are evidently robust country folks, thus set forth their case: "Do you see, Doctor, my dame and I be come to ax your advice - we both of us eat well, and drink well, and sleep well, - yet still we be somewhat queerish!" The Doctor is equal to the emergency and prepared to alter all this promptly. "You eat well, you drink well, and you sleep well, - very good. You were perfectly right in coming to me, for depend upon it I will give you something that shall do away with all these things!"
   1 Depiction: The personal belongings of the deceased -- her watch, little articles of jewelry and plate -- have evidently been ransacked by this affectionate pair of unaffected and disinterested mourners. An open book displays this familiar quotation, bearing somewhat disrespectful application to the case of the departed: "A smoky house and a scolding wife // Are the plagues of man's life. // Oh, what pleasure will abound // When my wife is laid in ground!"
   1 Depiction: The portrait shows Washington standing with his left hand on a fieldpiece, dressed in a different uniform from that in the Nassau Hall portrait (see Frontispiece). He wears a light blue ribbon across his waistcoat as the badge of the commander-in-chief. At the left, the building believed to be Nassau Hall can be seen in the distance behind marching Hessian prisoners. An attendant holds Washington's horse. At Washington's left, by his crossed legs, appear the inverted colors captured from the Hessians in the battle of Trenton on Christmas night 1776, and behind him is a fallen English standard. The flag with stars and stripes above the horse's head has occasioned much dispute. According to some authorities it was probably not employed so early as the end of December 1776 and the beginning of 1777, but was a flag first commonly used at the battle of the Brandy-wine in September 1777.
   1 Depiction: The preparations of the cook in question are not calculated to increase the appetite of the observant epicure. The chef is hideous, old, rheumy, solvenly, and diseased. He is kneading the paste with his objectionable hands, his snuffbox is on the board by his side, while a blowsy and uncombed slattern is reaching down a pie-dish, in which the rats have been reveling. The bold depredators are scampering off no farther than the next dish.
   1 Depiction: The principal figure in this picture is that of a young officer belonging to the British army opposed to the French legions on the Peninsular. In company with a Portuguese don he has come to visit one of the nunneries which were sufficiently abundant in the country. Three well-favoured members of the sisterhood and a sour-looking old harridan, by way of duenna, have come to the "grill" or large grated window, which was employed to cut off the "cloistered ones" from the rest of the world.
   1 Depiction: The principal figure in this plate is that of a corpulent individual, who is being measured by a meagre whipper-snapper anatomy of a tailor, the girth of his portly client is giving the knight of the needle no slight difficulty to surround his person with his measuring-tape, and the customer is impressing on his tailor the necessity of having ample room for his obese proportions.
   2 Depiction: The principal objects in the print are a still and a cask of double rectified spirits into which three members of the firm are involuntarily infusing foreign elements.
   1 Depiction: The print is illustrating the market, but the occasion of the gathering in the market is not very clear. It might be just a regular market day.
   1 Depiction: The print represents this mysterious plenipotentiary, with private correspondence in his hand, hurrying up to Mrs. Clarke's handsomely furnished mansion. The lady, who is at the open window on the look- out for her envoy, is crying, "Open the door, John , here comes the Ambassador. Now for the dear delightful answer." John Bull, with his dog at his side, who has apparently formed a suspicion of the Emperor's errand, is enquiring, "I say, Master Shoemaker, where be you going in such a woundy hurry?" To which the bustling confidential agent replies, "Don't speak to me, fellow,  you should never pry into State affairs."
   1 Depiction: The printer is a self-portrait of Cruikshank.
   1 Depiction: The process of investing a lady with her new corsage, demands an enormous exertion on the part of the tailor who has brought them.
   1 Depiction: The progress of the regiment is much impeded by camp- followers. A stream happening to cross the route, the marching party are wading through. The soldiers bearing in addition to their knapsack the fairer burden of a wife, and in some cases two infants, with kettles, gridirons, and other culinary appliances, the latter swinging on the end of their muskets. The officer commanding the party has the advantage of securing a mount on the plump shoulders of a pretty damsel, whose skirts are tucked up as a preparation towards wading across the water, with the feathered hero on her back.
   1 Depiction: The promenaders, in a state of sauve qui peut, are rushing off pell-mell in an attempt to preserve their dripping finery from the effects of a sudden thunderstorm. The park gates are crowded by the sudden exeunt omnes - pedestrians, horses and carriages are mixed in one confused mass in the struggle to escape from a miniature tempest. Peers and pedagogues, the man of fashion, in search of gallant adventures, and the hypochondriac limping parkwards to take the air. The ignorant, new fledged squire, the rustic dandy, whose head-dressing does not extend beyond the powdered and frizzed peruke, and the man of knowledge and philosophy, are thrown into violent contact, and unexpectedly realize whose cranium is the hardest, &amp;c. &amp;c.
   1 Depiction: The residence of Mrs. Clarke, at the corner of Gloucester Place, is made conspicuous to the public by a notification at one time practiced in respect to disreputable vicinities. A man is planted before the door holding a notice- board, warning the passers-by to 'beware of bad houses and naughty women.' A couple of watchmen, with their lanterns slung on the ends of long poles, are throwing a good light on the nature of the case. A clergyman and an officer, who were evidently coming direct to the establishment on private ends, are, by this publicity warned out of danger before their intention is disclosed to the public.
   1 Depiction: The restiveness referred to appears to be nothing more than a tendency to rest in one spot. A sailor, probably at Portsmouth, from the view of the sea and shipping, is mounted on a steed which he is vainly belabouring with a cudgel, while an old hag is banging away at the poor brute with a long and heavy broom, to the delight of a convivial party, assembled to drink outside a public house, within view of the dilemma.
   1 Depiction: The ring is formed in Moorfields, crowds of spectators are gathered around, the curious have climbed up every available point of sight, and observers are scrambling over the roofs "Magnanimous Paul O!" the mad Emperor, is represented as a Russian bear. His sword is tempered "a la Suwarrow," and his shield is inscribed "Swallow all O!" The British champion Pitt, encased in a demisuit of mail, is jauntily meeting his adversary . . . .
   1 Depiction: The same personages caricatured in the plate entitled 'The Prince's Answer To The Address Of The Deputation From Ireland' are represented in the sequal returning to Dublin. They have exchanged their favorite Irish bulls for donkeys. Their potatoes have gone but they are liberally provided with Regency Cakes in their place. Their Pope, whose donkey's head is ornamented with the plume of three feathers as borne by the Prince of Wales, is received by an eager deputation on his arrival: 'What news, what news? The tidings tell. Make haste, and tell us all. Say why are they thus mounted? Is the Regent come and all?' The leader is replying 'I'll tell you all in no time. Why, you must know the King is better than the Regent - that is all!' The Marquis of Lothian is declaring 'Master Walgee (Weltje) made us such Regent's and Regency cakes!'
   2 Depiction: The scene is still the polling-booth, Covent Garden. The canvassers, committees, and mobs are giving their entire attention to the performance carried on for their entertainment between the fair rival advocates, who are balanced at either end of a plank laid across a stone post . . . .
   1 Depiction: The scene of the situation is the green at Gretna, before the shed of Tim Tag, 'Blacksmith and Rector.' The worthy is in his clerical character, decently clad in professional sables. And, with spectacles on nose, he is reading the service, in a somewhat extemporary fashion, over a fugitive couple, in the open air. A dashing captain, dressed in his regimentals, as was then the everyday fashion in the King's service, is placing a ring on the finger of a comely maiden of tender years, who is smiling and blushing. The postilion who has driven the runaway pair to this stolen match is standing, cap in hand, grinning at the ceremonial. While the blacksmith is riveting the fetters of Hymen in his clerical character, his professional helpers are looking to the shoes of the horses which are to bear the newly married couple across the Border.
   1 Depiction: The scene takes place in a skyparlour, and the principal performer is a son of the Church.
   1 Depiction: The scrivener inhabits a poor, squalid office. His clerk is perched on a high stool by the window. The worthy wears a nightcap, and has a quill behind his ear. He is poring over a ledger at a tumbledown desk. One finger on his nose illustrates his absorption in some weighty deliberation. Files of accounts and boxes of deeds and papers form the rest of the scrivener's surroundings. Books on shelf have dates 1787, 1788 and 1789.
   1 Depiction: The situation of the Emperor, as pictured by Rowlandson, is becoming critical. He is elevated on a cask of "real Hollands Geneva" on the top of which he is dancing about in exasperation, unable to assist himself, and surrounded by his enemies, who are all putting the great conqueror to his wits end and revenging themselves by smoking out the Corsican. Each of the representatives of the rebellious States and Powers being armed with a pipe, and pouring volumes of the fumes round the person of the tortured general. Spain, Portugal, Hanover. The Cossack, the Pole, Austria, Sweden, Bavaria and Prussia, seated on a cannon, are all assisting. The King of Wurtemburg is provided with a flask of Wurtemburg drops.
   1 Depiction: The sketch on the recto is slightly different from that on the verso, the former depicts Mrs. Bumble hurling invectives at her humiliated spouse, on that of the verso the lady is about to hurl a bowl of soapsuds upon the browbeaten mate.
   1 Depiction: The sketch represents a view of the first thoroughfare where gas was employed to illuminate the streets . . . . The sightseers are lost in wonder and admiration at the novelty of finding gas burning in the streets. The lamps are arranged in branches of three. A gentleman of fashion is endeavoring to explain the science of gasmaking to an elegant creature on his arm . . . . Amongst other wonder-gazers is a country farmer, and a Quaker and his companion . . . . The more disreputable members of the community are reflecting that the new light will expose their depravities and put a stop to their commerce.
   2 Depiction: The soldier stands at the door of the witch's house.
   1 Depiction: The staircase of the handsome buildings erected for Somerset House originally set apart for the Exhibition of the Royal Academy is ridiculed as a scene of unequivocal confusion. Whether the dangers of the somewhat steep ascent were actually as hazardous as the artist has depicted is open to question. The situation is treated with a license which, perhaps, may be held to verge on the inadmissible.
   1 Depiction: The step pyramid of Djoser, with shepherds and their flock in the foreground.
   1 Depiction: The stout Duke of York has turned his sturdy back on his fair enslaver, declaring, "If I must march, I must. However, I shall leave by Baggage behind me!" . . . Mrs. Clarke, who is dressed precisely as she appeared at the bar of the House of Commons, is thus reproaching the York deserter: "O you gay deceiver, to leave a poor woman without protection!"
   1 Depiction: The stout sinner is humbling himself before the throne. A portion of the king's figure is concealed. The Duke of York has laid his Resignation, together with his coat, sword and cocked-hat, at the paternal feet, and kneeling in his denuded state, he is quoting the words of the parable of the Prodigal Son: 'Father I have sinned before thee, and I am no longer worthy to be called thy son.' The monarch, who seems deeply affected by the spectacle of his favourite son's abasement, is returning: 'Very naughty boy. Very naughty boy indeed! However, I forgive you, but don't do so any more.'
   1 Depiction: The stronghold in which an old Israelite has confined his treasure has enormous padlocks on the area gate and the door studded with nails. The proprietor has returned with provisions for a merry-making. A porter bearing on his head a basket containing geese, fowls, fish and fruit, with a flask of wine in his hand. The old curmudgeon's crutch is leaning against the door, and he is fumbling over the immense padlock, quite unconscious that a smart young officer, who has placed a ladder against the window of his lovely inamorata's apartment, is helping the captive bird to freedom from the clutches of her jealous jailer.
   1 Depiction: The success gained by the allied armies over Napoleon and his forces, and the series of French disasters which had culminated at Leipzig, gave rise to rejoicings all over the country, in celebration of the supposed downfall of the Corsican Emperor . . . . Norwich, according to the print, is the scene of disorderly revelry. A huge bullock has been roasted whole in the marketplace, and the carcass is being cut up and distributed in the streets. The unruly mob fighting over the morsels and wrenching the bones from those who are ravenously picking them. Scuffles, struggles, scrimmages, and savage onslaughts are the order of the day. At the same time a puncheon of beer or spirits is broached for gratutious distribution, and a pretty spectacle of misrule is the consequence.
   1 Depiction: The theatre stage and Shakespeare as an infant surrounded by the characters he created.
   1 Depiction: The troops forming the British Expedition which restored the Prince of Orange to his states are represented landing in the Texal, and delivering the Dutch from the hands of their friends the Sansculottes. British tar by the hand, heartily delighted to see a chance of recovering his freedom. A Dutch vrow is trampling her foot upon an order of the French Convention. She has secured a trifling comfort, a bottle of 'Holland gin.' The troops forming the English contingent are landing from their ships, and driving the French legions before them at the point of the bayonet.
   1 Depiction: The two conditions of Ague and Fever are ingeniously portrayed. The cold snake-like folds of Ague are twining round the shivering victim, seated as he is in the full heat of a blazing fire, while the quivering heats of Fever personified are in attendance, between the patient and his physician, waiting to add his persecutions to the infirmities which the sick man is already enduring.
   1 Depiction: The uncle, who is a sufferer from gout, is evidently a well-to-do personage. And the attentions of his relatives, who are favouring the sufferer with a visit of condolence, are, it appears, suggested by self-interest. One of the highly considerate relations seems good-naturedly assisting the invalid by making his will, while a pretty young damsel is embarrassing their interesting connection with a tender embrace, and altogether the members of the party are evidently set upon promoting their own prospects with a view to a division of the estate.
   1 Depiction: The varied humours of Portsmouth are displayed with the caricaturist's native vigor. The landing-place is bustling with business. Small craft of all sorts are pulling off to the ships. Luggage, spirit-casks and packages are being wheeled or shouldered off for embarkation. A commander, his lady and a porter are in the centre of the crowd.
   1 Depiction: The vendor of rat-traps is pausing before a shop decorated with such livestock as a rabbit in a hutch, and a jackdaw in a cage. He is offering his traps to a spectacled old gentleman, who is considering his ware with curiosity. The rats in a trap, carried on the trap-seller's arm, are exciting the interest of a dog.
   1 Depiction: The village Jack-of-all-Trades, a very imposing, grave and learned professor in appearance, is drawn in the exercise of one branch of his multifarious vocations. A stout wench has called in to have an obstinate grinder dragged out of her head "torment and torture" are mild terms for the operation. The patient is seated in the chair of agony. Factotum's assistant, a lad whose offices seem as diversified as those of his master, has brought an elegant pair of horse-pliers for the delicate process of extraction. A dog is setting up a sympathetic howl . . . .  An old country dame who is also distracted with a raging molar is waiting without . . . .
   1 Depiction: The waters of one of the parks, or of a frozen river. In the foreground is a scene of grotesque confusion, the ice has given way, and a party of skaters have fallen through. Heads, arms and skate-bound feet are waving over the hole, through which a group of unfortunates are engulphed. A little distance off the face of another unfortunate is thrust through a hole in the ice, wigless, and wearing the sort of alarm one could conceive under the circumstances. Further on half a face, with a wig and pig-tail attached, is visible, the owner of which is evidently shouting for assistance.
   1 Depiction: The wondrous fluid Macassar is seen in application. A stout old party has laid off his fool's cap and is seated in an armchair, undergoing a trial of the efficacy of the oil. The perfectly bald head of the subject is a good field for its employment, and the operator - who, by some inconsistency characteristic of vendors of hair restoratives, is quite bereft of hair himself - is sleepily pouring oil from a flask over the broad surface beneath him. A lady has apparently been making a trial of the process, and on consulting the looking-glass she seems amazed to find a bushy head of hair pushing itself straight upwards with amazing vigour.

Groups of gentlemen engaged in the 'black business' are seated at tables, enjoying their long clay pipes, or otherwise diverting themselves with romping and horse-play. The members of another party, preparing to resume their route back to the metropolis, are on the roof of their hearse, their legs hanging over the side with pastoral-like simplicity, smoking their 'church- wardens' and hobnobbing their pewter quart pots with true bacchanalian appreciation of the enjoyments of the hour. The results of too indiscriminate indulgence are noticeable in the dangerous situation of these coaches which are attempting to 'homeward wend their melancholy way' and are being over-turned in the process by their tipsy drivers.

An old fright is trying on an unbecoming straw-bonnet at a mirror, while a handsome saleswoman is puffing her wares. A number of pretty apprentices are trimming hats, and an antiquated quiz, with his spy-glass, is poking his head through the window, and saluting the bevy of beauties with a satyr-like grin.

An old Commodore illustrates the idea of a life spent in warfare - although minus an eye and a leg, he is tough and hearty, and is seemingly content with his pipe and bowl. The brutalizing results of hours devoted to mere bestial intoxication are realized in the person of a slovenly and imbecile sot.

   1 Depition: In this case the dog has run between the legs of a man bringing in a dish of cutlets, which bestrew the carpet. His downfall has in turn overset another retainer, whose soup tureen has come to grief. The butler, more engaged in watching the calamities of his fellows, has allowed the "spruce beer" to escape in a shower of froth all over the place. The scene is well worked out. Over the door of the dining-room is a picture representing a party of corpulent friars seated round a refectory board.  The faces of the party - it is a bachelor dinner in this instance - express more annoyance than alarm. They are dejected at the prospect of a curtailed repast.

   1 Image description: The incident depicted is taking place at the door of the rectory, beside the church porch, where a crane has been erected for the accommodation of the gouty and unwieldy divine. Two frisky and solidly-built damsels are hauling away at a rope, to which a sling is attached. The corpulent rector is swinging in mid air, preparatory to being lowered into the saddle. In his pocket is shown a discourse on the opposite text - 'He that humbleth himself shall be exalted.' A grinning groom is holding the head of a high-cruppered horse.
  72 Images are attributed to Felix Bonfils; later images may also be attributed to his son Adrien. With his wife Lydie, Bonfils opened Maison Bonfils, a photographic studio, in Beirut ca. 1870.

   1 Inscribed in letterpress: 'All foxes in their sapience predict each winter's imminence: luxuriant of clothes, they go significant of future snow. Small covenants of instant spring, birds fly upon prophetic wing, attesting that the stream long lost will move, enfranchised from the frost. With such supply of augury men know which season is to be; yet they are never weather-wise though they employ attentive eyes: a certain winter and a spring own dates beyond their reckoning. For seasons in the skull elude prediction: no mind's solitude was ever host to fur or feather prophetic of approaching weather.'

Loss of the SS President Coolidge was announced by the Navy, December 12, 1942."
   1 Inscribed with stamp, verso: "Always aware of the vastness of Pacific spaces and the far-scattered bases that we held there, the Navy long ago sought to perfect its technique for fueling at sea so that in the eventuality of war ships might not be limited to a comparatively short operation radius from shore bases. When Pearl Harbor came the Navy's refueling technique had been perfected to such a high peak of efficiency that fueling at sea was considered not more than a routine exercise. Not restricted to fueling from shore, task forces teamed out for weeks and months, fueled at sea as a matter of course. It was this ability to operate over prolonged periods that enabled our men-of-war to steam repeatedly deep into enemy held waters on strikes of longer range than ever before known in the history of naval warfare. Calling for the smartest kind of seamanship, fueling at sea would be hazardous even in calm waters were it not for the smartly trained crews to whom this operation is entrusted. In heavy seas there is still danger, for as these first published pictures show, the fueled and fueling ships must be brought alongside and kept alongside for the duration of the fueling. // It's a yo-heave-ho with an adagio step thrown in as these men on a destroyer disregard the lack of footing to haul in a line during refueling from the USS Bennington. The fuel hose (left) already has been passed from the carrier, but has yet to be secured. It was expert fueling under conditions such as these that enabled our task forces to stay out at sea for months in the long range strikes against the homeland of the enemy."

   1 Inscribed with stamp, verso: "Four times the USS Intrepid has been battered into flames by Jap air action, and four times the big Essex-class carrier has returned to rain more destruction upon the enemy. In 15 months of combat operation, the Intrepid's guns and planes have sunk 80 ships and destroyed 650 aircraft. That she is the most frequently hit carrier in the U.S. Navy makes this record even more incredible. The Intrepid was first hit off Truk by an aerial torpedo during the initial raids on this stronghold, February 16, 1944. Back in action off Luzon, October 29, the flattop took one of the first successful Jap suicide hits. Again on November 25, two Jap kamikases rocketed into her flight deck to turn the big carrier into a blazing gasoline-fed inferno. Even though "abandoning" seemed the only logical answer, the crew battled heroically for two-and-one-half hours to save their ship. In action again for the Okinawa campaign, Intrepid pilots helped send the 45,000-ton battleship Yamato to the bottom. Then on April 16, while her airmen were carrying the war to Japan's home islands, the Intrepid was hit for a fourth time by one of the five attacking suicide planes. Her battle damage repaired for a fourth time, the Intrepid lives up to a proud name. The "ghost" of many Jap "sinkings" has long since rejoined the fleet. // Firefighters almost hidden by smoke turn hoses on dozens of small fires started by bombs from the suicide planes which crashed the USS Intrepid, November 25, off the coast of Luzon. About 60 men died in the blasts from those hits."

   1 Inscribed with stamp, verso: "Less than 16 months after she was commissioned, the stricken Essex-class aircraft carrier USS Franklin arrived at Brooklyn Navy Yard under her own power--a ghastly but unforgettable memorial to the heroism of those who man the Navy's ships and the skill of those who build them. Behind the gallant hulk was an excruciating ordeal which few warships have survived. The Franklin's agony began on March 19, 1945, when she was participating in air strikes against the Jap fleet in the Inland Sea. Operating less than 60 miles from the Japanese coast, with many of her planes fully armed and fuelled, the carrier was suddenly attacked by a Jap dive-bomber, which scored hits with two 500-pound armor-piercing bombs. The ship was soon an inferno - a cauldron of flame, exploding bombs and rockets, racked by explosions and reverberating with a bedlam of detonations and voices raised in pain or command. To horrified onlookers she was a blur of fire and smoke . . . But when the veil lifted, the Franklin was still there. Gutted by flame, listing badly, and suffering from more than 1,000 casualties, the carrier painfully limped the thousands of miles back to New York. // As the cruiser Santa Fe moves away from the Franklin the burning carrier lists so badly she seems ready to capsize. Driven back by the flames, members of the skeleton crew cluster forward on the flight deck, awaiting assignment to fire fighting details."

   1 Inscribed with stamp, verso: "The USS Ticonderoga, new Essex class carrier, has left a blistering trail of incredible destruction during its first three months in the Pacific. While the crew came to know the mighty flattop as the big 'T', the Japs know her only as 'trouble'. More than once they concentrated attacks on the carrier without success. It wasn't until after the 'T's' rampage through the South China Sea that the Nips caught up with their number one priority. On January 21, 1945, while operating off the coast of Formosa, the big 'T' was hit by two suicide planes within half an hour. While smoke and flames billowed high into the air from the stricken ship, Tokyo hastened to announce another carrier 'instantaneously sunk'. Efforts of a gallant crew saved the ship that day. Inspired workmen of west coast yard have since restored the carrier to A-1 fighting shape. Today, the Ticonderoga again roams enemy waters adding more destruction to an already enviable record. // Smoke pours from bomb hole following first suicide attack on the Ticonderoga. Bomb-carrying suicide plane crashed forward of bomb hit near the number one elevator. Thick cloud of smoke in the top right hand corner comes from the elevator. Note the splintered deck and the casualty at the left in this picture, snapped moments after the first Jap hit."

   1 Item description: "Fives" is now a name which has a particular sense applicable only to two variations of a single game. Once it could be applied to all games played with the hand and the ball. And all games now played with a racket were once played with the hand and known to everyone as "Fives." Even Badminton is not excepted from this statement, for it is more than probable that the original shuttlecock was nothing more than a flying ball. It started being called Jeu de Paume, and was about playing with the fist, then the fist was covered with a leather glove as in boxing. The glove gave way and kept evolving till it ended up being the Tennis raquet. The main games where: Rackets, Squash Rackets, Tennis, Fives and Badminton. Fives itself was played using both hands. In 12th century France courts were erected, or a part of the building was put aside for play, at many castles, and this was but the small beginnings of a popularity which was to sweep the country.

After first analyzing the colors of the portrait, they decided on the number of stencils necessary and also the order in which the stencils should be applied to the black and white key plate. When the first color proofs were checked against the colors of the portrait itself, it was found necessary to make a corrected color proof, and this involved also making some corrections to the black and white proof. The collotype key plate was therefore re-proofed after which a second color proof was made. With minor changes this was approved, whereupon the Meriden Gravure Company printed the necessary number of black and white key plates, and by means of twenty-six stencils the water colors were applied by hand to each of the five hundred copies. It was only by means of this long and complicated process--a process chosen after the other available color processes had been considered and rejected--that the greatest possible fidelity to the original portrait could be achieved.

   2 Item description: Engraving of Rivington by Francis Scott King after an oil portrait by Gilbert Stuart. Oval portrait framed in a classical motif, with books and a newspaper beneath. Rivington, a successful London bookseller, emigrated to the American colonies in 1760. He set up shop first in Philadelphia; the next year he moved to New York and opened a bookshop on Wall Street. In 1773 he began publishing the "New York Gazetteer" a Tory paper whose press was destroyed by patriots two years later. He fled to England but returned with a new press to America in 1777 after the British captured New York City. By 1781, when it became doubtful whether the colonies would remain part of the british crown, Rivington acted as a spy for the Americans and furnished Washington with information on the occupation of New York. However, his newspaper's reputation had already been severely compromised and he was unable ever again to attract a loyal readership, even after the end of the Revolution. --John Waite Rare Books

   1 Item description: The Kanji text next ot the image explains that this scene is part of a series entitled, "Twenty-four hours at Shinbashi &amp; Yanagibashi: 12 noon." This series depicts each hour in a geisha's day, of which this particular image is for the noon hour, when the Geisha has her photograph taken. The photographer whose studio she is in is identified as Tsukuba Kitaniwa, and his studio was in the Asakusa district of Tokyo. The Seisha in this print is dressed in a purple Kimono and sits for her portrait in Kitaniwa's studio. The literal text is "Shinryu nijuyojikan; Twenty-four hours of the budding willow." Sebastian Dobson explains tht the word 'Shinryu' has a double meaning here. It is a poetic reference to the willow tree, but it also conceals an elegant contraction of the Chinese characters for the famous Tokyo pleasure quarters of Shinbaski and Yanagibashi.--from Charles Schwartz CS3466.
   2 Item description: The Praxinoscope was an animation device, the successor to the zoetrope. It was invented in France in 1877 by Charles-Émile Reynaud. Like the zoetrope, it used a strip of pictures placed around the inner surface of a spinning cylinder. The praxinoscope improved on the zoetrope by replacing its narrow viewing slits with an inner circle of mirrors, placed so that the reflections of the pictures appeared more or less stationary in position as the wheel turned. Someone looking in the mirrors would therefore see a rapid succession of images producing the illusion of motion, with a brighter and less distorted picture than the zoetrope offered. In 1889 Reynaud developed the Théâtre Optique, an improved version capable of projecting images on a screen from a longer roll of pictures. This allowed him to show hand-drawn animated cartoons to larger audiences, but it was soon eclipsed in popularity by the photographic film projector of the Lumière brothers.

The boys watched their fathers 'drill' and 'as the cock crows, the young on learns,' ... This account of my playing at soldiers may appear to be rather trifling and nonsensical, but just see what it has done for me ... It has made me - aye me, G. C. fit and able to handle a musket or a rifle, and fall into ranks of an infantry regiment at a moment's notice.'

The queen of this paradise agrees to let him go and gives him a box to take back with him, but tells him he must not open it.

   1 Item description: [as described by vendor] 'A charming collection of expertly cut silhouettes of theatrical figures, preserved in a custom made box from the collections of Donald and Mary Hyde (with bookplate). They are made from a laid watermarked paper, probably form the 1820-1830 period. They are mostly figures from Shakespeare, and some are identified lightly in pencil: Charles 5th, Iago, Francis 1st (?), Wm. Shakespeare, Catherine of Braganza, Leopold, Madonna, Queen Christine of Sweden, Themble (?) as Coriolanus, England, etc. One of them has the name "Miss J. Hunter" written in the margin; this might be the name of the person who made them. 'Silhouette' is given a good entry in M. Rickards, ENCYCLOPEDIA OF EPHEMERA: "Among Britain's notable silhouettists was Sarah Harrington of Bath, who also introduced technological innovations. Her patent machine for cutting 'hollow profiles' reversed the normal treatment: her silouettes [sic] were cut in white paper, the outer area of which was retained and placed over black paper." That is exactly what we have here (though it is not clear is these were cut by machine or by hand). They look to me to be hand cut. I have seen a few collections of the conventional black silhouettes in the marketplace, but the present examples are, I believe, very rare.'

   1 John Bull, a very giant among a race of pigmies, is surrounded by the heads of the different states, who are all hurling out threats against his chances of peace. Napoleon is thundering for Ships, Colonies and Commerce. The Muscovite is denouncing: "Russian vengeance attend John Bull." Holland is blustering: "I'll eternally smoke him." The other potentates are following up these threats with valedictions of their own: "Beware of Prussia", "Austria will never pardon him", "Spanish fury overtake him", and "Let him beware of Denmark". John Bull is smiling good-naturedly at all these empty vapourings, "Don't make such a riot, you little noisy brats, all your bustle to me is no more than a storm in a [house pond]".

   1 Joseph Viscomi, 4/2006: Many thanks for the image of Urizen plate 9 from Small Book of Designs copy B. Actually, copy B of both the Large Book and Small Book is a bibliographical invention, because most of the impressions are second pulls, impressions pulled from the plate while the ink was still wet. However, your impression does not have a corresponding impression in copy A (there are one or two others like that in copy B).

   1 Publisher information: In 1796, Jean Charles Pellerin set up the Imagerie d’Epinal and popularised printed images of everyday scenes. New publishers emerged in Epinal in the 19th century, including Charles Pinot and his Nouvelle Imagerie d’Epinal. The emergence of this new company resulted in a war in the production of images that was eventually won by Imagerie Pellerin d’Epinal. This publishing house ended up becoming the leading French firm in the field and in 1888 it bought out all of Pinot’s stock.

   1 Text of the print reads: 'Alex Reeds upper Cut against the bold Smuglers bodier. Boshop Sharpe the conquorer of 23 Battles, obliged  to surrender for the First Time. A more determined Manly contest was never witnessed in the Prize Ring. Sharpe has suffered defeat,  disgrace is out the question. His character is if possible raised higher than ever, kfor displaying such fortitude, such unflinching game, that he has placed now his reputation for those qualities, beyond all praise. Reed won the Battle in a style highly creditable  to him . Sharpe could only be conquoed by being fought at precise points &amp; out generaled. Alex never threw a chance away. He was alwa ys on his guard, and the manner in which he frequently parried his antagonists hist, and the rapidity, and precision of his returns  whith both hands, delighted the admirers of the Fine Science.[etc.].

   1 The Advance Guard of the Feast, appeared in the December 21, 1912 issue of Harper’s Weekly, p.24.
   1 The Club Bindery was established by the Grolier Club, New York City, in the 1890s.
   1 The Kick-up is of a serious character/ the gamblers who lately occupied the front of the table are upset in the confusion, and others are endeavoring to get out of the way of the danger.  A stout old buck in the King's uniform - a loser, it would seem, from his empty pocketbook - has drawn his pistol on a player opposite, who has presumably won the irate gentleman's gold since he is covering the pile with one hand, and with the other is aiming, in his turn, a pistol full at his adversary's person.  Great excitement prevails around/ one man is dashing a chair at the officer's outstretched firearm, and a brother officer is striking with a bottle and a candlestick at the other weapon/ bludgeons are flourished and swords are drawn by some of the gamblers, while others are endeavoring to stand clear before the bullets begin to fly.
   1 The Library of Congress has confirmed that these huts are mislabeled and are located in Petersburg, Va. Their title "Surgeon's Quarters, camp of 50th New York Engineers in front of Petersburg, Va."
   1 The Small stamp (LH bottom corner) reads: 'PRINTSELLERS ASSOCIATION F 1''.  Along the bottom right of the print 'Copyright May 1st 1916 by Alfred Bell &amp; Co 6 Old Bond Street, W. Copyright in America by Samuel Schwartz Sons &amp; Co. 290 Fifth Avenue New York USA 1916'.
   1 The Teddyfication of the White House, published as the centerfold in Puck v. 65, no. 1669 (February 24, 1909)
   1 The alternative descriptive title is that of the Grolier Club exhibition in 1905. Used by Butlin also.
   1 The date of publication of the print was deliberate. From 21 February 1916 German forces battled with the French for control of Verdun and the surrounding villages and countryside, with great loss of life on both sides. By May 1916 battle continued to rage with losses and successes on both sides and the uncertain fate of Verdun had come to symbolize the fate of France itself. Brewer's timeless, tranquil image of the town at peace would have chimed in with all those concerned for France's future.'--email Richard Shaw

   1 The tree's author, Félix Gallet, was a French national, a post-master working at the time at the bureau des postes in Geneva, and most probably a native of Châteauneuf-sur-Loire, near Orléans. Le Monde Primitif, mentioned as the inspiration for the tree, was a major historical-philological treatise composed by Antoine Court de Gébelin, incidentally (and interestingly perhaps for an American audience) a friend of Benjamin Franklin's.

   1 This rendering of the iconic Trumbull painting of the presentation of the Declaration of Independence to the Continental Congress in Independence Hall was the inspiration of Arthur E. Wullschleger, a Swiss textile entrepreneur who maintained offices in New York City and Lyon, France. The commission required the construction of a special building in Lyon, furnished with six Verol Jacquard pattern shedding mechanisms. The first issue was completed in 1928 after three years of work; the weavings were said to have been intended as gifts to Wullschleger’s friends in the silk industry and to American embassies around the world. In 1956 Wullschleger presented one of the weavings and the loom on which it was created to the Smithsonian Institution.

   1 Through her partner, Ford Madox Ford, Janice Biala met the poet Allen Tate (1899-1979) and Tate’s wife Caroline Gordon (1895-1981), who worked as Ford’s secretary. The Tates invited Ford and Biala to spend time at their antebellum home on the Cumberland river near Clarksville, Tennessee. Purchased with the help of Tate’s brother Ben, the house was dubbed Ben’s Folly or Benfolly. In the summers it was filled with visiting writers and artists, as seen in Biala’s painting.
